On this website we discuss variety of <a href="/topics/">topics</a> related to the research interests of our research group in [Vilniaus University](http://www.vu.lt/) [Faculty of Physics](http://www.ff.vu.lt/) [Institute of Theoretical Physics and Astronomy](http://www.tfai.vu.lt). We try to cover research done by us as well as related research carried out by other groups from around the world. The covered <a href="/topics/">topics</a> are rather well encompassed by the term Physics of Risk, hence the name and the logo of this website. Originally this term was a title of EU COST project, which ran from 2004 to 2008 (two members of our group were part of this project).

This website was created while executing EU structural fund project "Mokslas. Mokslininkai. Visuomenė." (en. "Science. Scientists. Society."; ran from 2006 to 2008) and further extended during Inogeb-1 project "Mokslas verslui ir visuomenei" (en. "Science for business and society"; ran from 2009 to 2011). During these projects articles for this website were written by various members of our group, as well as by some authors who no longer work with us - V. Daniūnas, M. Alaburda, T. Meškauskas.

Currently this website is maintaned by [Aleksejus Kononovičius](http://kononovicius.lt).
