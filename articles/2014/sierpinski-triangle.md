Sierpinski triangle is a fractal named
after Polish mathematician Waclaw Sierpinski, who was the first one to
describe it in scientific literature (in 1915). The fractal itself is
interesting in a sense that it is a two dimensional atractor to couple
iterative operations related to triangles (primarily).

In this text we will discuss iterative removal of triangles, shrinking
and duplication, chaos game. We will also briefly mention Lindenmayer
system, cellular automata and Pascal's
triangles.<!--more-->

Iterative removel of triangles
------------------------------

Iterative removel of triangles is the main Sierpinski triangle
construction algorihtm and it is formulated as:

1. Let us start with an equilateral triangle.
2. Subdivide it into four smaller congruent equilateral triangles.
3. Remove the central smaller triangle - leave only ones on the sides.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 with each of the remaining smaller triangles.

Observe this algorithm in HTML5 app below. Using buttons "+" and "-"
you can influence the maximal precision (recursive depth) in which the
fractal is drawn. Observe self-similarity of the structure.

Shrinking and duplication
-------------------------

Alternatively you could do the following:

1. Choose any geometric object. There is no need to choose equilateral
   triangle.
2. Shrink it two times and make three copies of it. Two copies should
   form a base, while the third should be placed on top.
3. Repeat step 2 with all three copies.

Observe this algorithm in HTML5 app below. Once again use buttons "+"
and "-" to influence the maximal precision (recursive depth) in which
the fractal is drawn. Observe how a square starts to look like
Sierpinski triangle.

Chaos game
----------

This case is slightly more interesting as it is no longer deterministic
- the actions in this "game" are chosen at random. The only definite
thing is three main points. The algorithm itself is formulated as:

1. Choose three points, which could be connected to form a triangle.
   There is no need to connect them. Let us call them main points.
2. Choose a random point inside the triangle. Mark this point. Let us
   call it current position.
3. Select randomly any of the three main points.
4. Find a mid-point between the current position and selected main
   point. Mark this point. This point is our new current position.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 with the new current positions.

In the HTML5 app below we have show the main points as larger squares
colored in three colors - red, green and blue. These colors ar used when
select color for the marking of the new current position (step 4). Note
that colors stay separated and are near the appropriate main point.

Other ways to obtain Sierpinski triangle
----------------------------------------

One of the methods, previously discussed on Physics of Risk, to obtain
Sierpinski triangle is cellular automata, [Wolfram's elementary
automatons](/wolframs-elementary-automatons "Wolfram elementary automatons").
Rules 60 and 102 generate right Sierpinski triangles, while rule 90
generates ordinary Sierpinski triangle.

Two more ways to obtain Sierpinski triangle are related to the
Lindenmayer sistem. One is related to the arrowhead curve, which in this
sistem is described as:  
`Initial condition: A, Angle: 60 deg, Rules: A -> B-A-B, B -> A+B+A.`  
While the other is related to the direct implementation of the borders
in Sierpinski triangle:  
`Initial condition: AB-AA-AA, Angle: 120 deg, Rules: A -> AA, B -> -AB+AB+AB-AA.`

Finally the last mehtod, considered in this text, is related to the
[Pascal's
triangle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle "Article on Wikipedia").
You should simply color cells with odd numbers black.
