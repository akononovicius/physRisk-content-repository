[Previously](/acchieving-high-clustering-in-scale-free-networks)
we have already mentioned that there are three main statistical features
of networks. The most problematic of them appears to be clustering as
random networks do not naturally form local, tightly interconnected,
communities. In the previous text we discussed a simple model, which
produces highly clustered scale-free networks. The problem is that it is
rather hard to relate that model to any real complex system. In this
text we will attempt to solve this problem.<!--more-->

Formulation of model
--------------------

-   Start with an empty graph with \\\(  m\_0 \\\) nodes (in our applet
    \\\(  m\_0 = m \\\)).
-   During the following steps add one new node and \\\(  m \\\) links:
    -   First link is chosen according to (a) preferential attachment
        (see [description of Barabasi-Albert
        model](/barabasi-albert-model)).
    -   Other \\\(  m-1 \\\) links may be formed (b) with neighbors of
        the node previously selected with preferential attachment (this
        mechanism is called "triad formation") or (a) with other nodes
        selected using preferential attachment. Mechanism (b) is
        executed with probability \\\(  p \\\) and mechanism (a) with
        probability \\\(  1-p \\\).

Two network formation mechanisms in the discussed model. In subfigure
(a) we see a node 'u' was selected via preferential attachment
mechanism, next using triad formation mechanism node 'w' was chosen
(subfigure (b)). Note that crossed out nodes cannot be selected with
triad formation mechanism as one of them is 'u' node, while other are
neighbors of 'w', but not neighbors of 'u'. Figure taken from original
article (see references)."){#attachment_2687} 

We would like to claim that "triad formation" mechanism is rather
realistic as similar mechanics are behind social interactions between
humans. We first get to know a certain person and only then he may
introduce us to his friends.

This model was proposed and thoroughly analyzed in \[cite
id="Holme2002PhysRevE"\]. This model is known to generate [scale-free
networks](/tag/scale-free-network), but the
clustering coefficient in networks generated using this model is
positive (the precise value depends on both model parameters). Typical
evolution of clustering coefficient as well as degree distribution are
shown in the figure below.

number of nodes (as time), also node degree

We invite you to test this model using our interactive applet.
