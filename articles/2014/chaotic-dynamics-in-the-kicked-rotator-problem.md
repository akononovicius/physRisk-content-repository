Kicker rotator (or rotor) problem is one of
the classical examples of dynamical chaos in physics. The focus of this
problem is a particle which moves in circular motion (e.g., pendulum on
a stick). This particle is being acted upon periodically, lets assume
that \\\(  T=1 \\\), by homogenous field (e.g. gravitational field, which
is being turned on periodically for a brief periods of time). When the
field is on, it creates a force, acting on the particle, of strength
\\\(  K \\\). As field is on only for a very brief periods of time, the
force may be approximated by the Dirac delta
function.<!--more-->

The following Hamiltonian may be written for this system:


\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{H}\[p(t),x(t),t\] = \frac{p(t)^2}{2} + K\cos\[x(t)\] \sum\_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t-n) . 
\end{equation}


For anyone familiar with classical mechanics, it should be easy to
obtain the following Hamiltonian equations (lets, for the sake of
simplicity, assume that \\\(  R=1 \\\) and \\\(  m=1 \\\)):


\begin{equation}
 \partial\_t \omega(t) = K \sin\[x(t)\]\sum\_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t-n) , \quad \partial\_t x(t) =\omega(t) . 
\end{equation}


These equations maybe solved by noting that we have two distinct cases -
one in which external force is absent, \\\(  n &lt; t &lt; t' &lt;n+1 \\\),


\begin{equation}
 \omega\_{t'} = \omega\_t , \quad x\_{t'} = x\_t + \omega\_t(t' - t) , 
\end{equation}


and other in which external force is present, \\\(  n &lt;n+1-\varepsilon &lt; t \lesssim t' &lt; n+1+\varepsilon \\\) (\\\( \varepsilon \rightarrow +0 \\\)),


\begin{equation}
 \omega\_{t'} = \omega\_t + \Delta \omega , \quad x\_{t'} =x\_t + \omega\_{t} (t' - t) , 
\end{equation}



\begin{equation}
 \Delta \omega = K\int\_{n+1-\varepsilon}^{n+1+\varepsilon} \sin\[x(t)\]\delta(t-n-1) \mathrm{d} t = K \sin\[x(n+1)\] . 
\end{equation}


Thus analytical model may be well approximated by the following set of
difference equations:


\begin{equation}
 x\_{t+1} = ( x\_t + \omega\_{t}) \,\mathrm{mod}\, 2 \pi ,\quad \omega\_{t+1} = \omega\_t + K \sin(x\_{t+1}) . 
\end{equation}


Here a pair of \\\(  (x\_t , \omega\_t) \\\) describes particle's
coordinate and radial speed (same magnitude as momentum) after \\\( t \\\)th kick. A set of \\\(  (x\_t , \omega\_t) \\\) curves for a given
\\\(  K \\\) and few distinct initial conditions, \\\(  (x\_0,\omega\_0) \\\), is called Poincare plot. This plot gives basic insight
into deterministic and chaotic dynamical behavior of the system.

Applet with two curves
----------------------

In order to better understand the Poincare plot, one should start from a
simple case with two curves. In the applet below we have selected two
curves with extremely similar initial conditions, but qualitatively
differing trajectories (one resonates with periodic force, while the
other doesn't). Red ball starts with \\\(  (x\_0, \omega\_0) \\\), while
the initial conditions of blue ball are similar (in the applet below
you may choose deviations from the initial conditions of red ball).
Experiment with the default settings and also try some other sets of
initial conditions. Note that you may also change the strength of the
kicks, \\\(  K \\\). Period of the external force was set to one second.

Many trajectory Poincare plot and Standard map
----------------------------------------------

In the applet below you may study the Poincare plot of the kicked
rotator with \\\(  N\_{trajectories} \\\) trajectories present. For the
sake of simplicity the initial conditions of each trajectory are
selected automatically - \\\(  x\_0 =\pi \\\) , \\\(  \omega\_0 =\frac{2 \pi i}{N\_{trajektorijų}} \\\) (here \\\(  i = 0, 1, \ldots,N\_{trajectories} \\\)). Each trajectory is plotted until it becomes closed
(some point is visited the second time) or until it has \\\( N\_{max.points} \\\) points.

Note that for small \\\(  K \\\) there are only few resonating
trajectories - most of them circle single period point, \\\(  (\pi,0) \\\), and two double period points - \\\(  (0, \pi) \\\) and \\\( (\pi, \pi) \\\). As \\\(  K \\\) increases (we encourage you to try
\\\(  0.1 \\\), \\\(  0.5 \\\), \\\(  1 \\\), \\\(  1.5 \\\), \\\(  2 \\\)
and \\\(  5 \\\)) number of resonant trajectories increases and the
encircle more different period points (tripple period, quadruple period
and so on). With large values of \\\(  K \\\) whole phase space of
\\\(  (x, \omega) \\\) is filled with resonant period points and
trajectories become apparently random (chaotic as they are of
deterministic nature).

Note that this applet allows to restrict \\\(  \omega \\\) to the
interval of \\\(  (0, 2 \pi) \\\). From the physical system point of
view, this makes no sense as both radial speed and momentum may obtain
any value (indeed the values escape this range for larger values of
\\\(  K \\\)). Yet if \\\(  \omega \\\) is restricted, then we obtain
interesting case known as Standard, or Chirikov-Zaslavsky, map.
