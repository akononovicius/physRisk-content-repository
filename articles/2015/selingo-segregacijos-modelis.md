Around 1970 American economist Tom
Schelling published couple well cited articles in which he tried to
explain racial segregation observed in larger cities in US \[cite
id="Schelling2006"\]. He tried to comprehend how and why racial
neighborhoods were forming and becoming so prominent. He wanted to know
if ubiquitous racial segregation is caused by rising racial tensions or
the same result might be present in a rather tolerant
society.<!--more-->

## Agent model

Schelling proposed a simple agent-based model to answer this question.
In his model agents are constantly looking for a good place to live on
grid. Initial grid is populated randomly with different types of agents
as well as some cells being left empty. Then random agents check if they
like their neighborhood or not. Agents like their neighborhood based on
the similarity of types of their neighbors. If they do not like it, they
try to move to other empty cells.

Bellow you will find a HTML5 app in which agents may be of two types -
reds and blues. Initially, while populating the grid with agents, two
parameters are important - probability that cell might be empty, \\\( p\_e \\\), and probability that non-empty cell contains red agent, \\\( p\_r \\\). After going through all cells and forming initial configuration,
random agents are picked one at a time. The agent counts number of his
nearest neighbors of the same type, \\\(  N^{(i,j)}\_s \\\) (here
\\\(  (i,j) \\\) is cell coordinate), and also a number of nearest
neighbors of the different type, \\\(  N^{(i,j)}\_o \\\). If \\\( \frac{N^{(i,j)}\_s}{N^{(i,j)}\_s + N^{(i,j)}\_o} \geq h \\\) (here
\\\(  h \\\) is a model parameter) holds, then agent is happy with his
current neighborhood and he remains at his current location. Otherwise
agent moves to a random empty cell.

## Interactive HTML5 app

Use the bellow app to see how the model results change when more/less
space becomes available (increase/decrease \\\(  p\_e \\\)), when society
is more/less heterogeneous (deviations from \\\(  p\_r = 0.5 \\\)) or
when society is more/less tolerant (decrease/increase \\\(  h \\\)). On
the left side you can always see how current grid state looks like. On
the right you can see a plot with fraction of happy agents (number of
happy agents divided by total number of agents) and mean segregation
(mean value of \\\(  \frac{N^{(i,j)}\_s}{N^{(i,j)}\_s +N^{(i,j)}\_o} \\\) over all agents).

Note that mean segregation is always larger than \\\(  h \\\). Thus
agents are not as intolerant as collective dynamics would suggest.
