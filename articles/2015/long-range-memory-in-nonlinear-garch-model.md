Recently journal Physica A accepted
our, A. Kononovicius and J. Ruseckas, manuscript titled "Nonlinear GARCH
model and 1/f noise" \[cite id="Kononovicius2015PhysA"\]. In this
article we shown that simple memory-less model with nonlinear term may
exhibit interesting stylized fact - long-range memory. Our manuscript is
even more interesting due to the fact that considered model (and its
various modifications) is somewhat widely used by the practitioners.

[Last
time](/power-law-distribution-in-linear-garch-model)
we have shown that GARCH(1,1) modeli is able to produce power law
distributions, but not a long-range memory. In this text we introduce
nonlinearity into GARCH(1,1) model and demonstrate that the modified
model exhibits long-range memory.<!--more-->

Comparison between stochastic differential equation obtained from
GARCH(1,1) and a general class of stochastic differential equations
proposed by us and our colleagues \[cite
id="Kaulakys2004PhysRevE,Kaulakys2006PhysA,Kaulakys2009JStatMech"\],


\begin{equation}
 \mathrm{d} x = \sigma^2 \left( \eta - \frac{\lambda}{2}\right) x^{2 \eta -1} \mathrm{d} t + \sigma x^\eta \mathrm{d} W, \label{xsde}
\end{equation}


shows that equations themselves are rather similar, but the similarity
is restricted to \\\(  \eta=1 \\\) case. Yet in order to reproduce
long-range memory (\\\(  1/f \\\) spectra) we need to have \\\(  \eta\neq 1 \\\). This can be done by making some terms nonlinear. Let us write
the following nonlinear process:


\begin{equation}
 \sigma^2\_{t} = a\_1 + b\_1 \sigma^\mu\_{t-1}\omega^\mu\_{t-1} + c\_1 \sigma^2\_{t-1} , 
\end{equation}


here \\\(  \mu &gt; 2  \\\) is odd integer. This iterative equation may
be rewritten as stochastic differential equation in respect to \\\(  y= \sigma^2 \\\):


\begin{equation}
 \mathrm{d} y = \left( \frac{A}{y^{\mu-1}} -\frac{C}{y^{\mu-2}} \right) y^{\mu -1} \mathrm{d} t + | B |y^{\mu/2} \mathrm{d} W , 
\end{equation}


here \\\(  A = \lim\limits\_{h \rightarrow 0}\frac{a\_{1,h}}{h} \\\), \\\(  C = \lim\limits\_{h \rightarrow 0}\frac{1-c\_{1,h}}{h} \\\) and \\\(  B^2 = \lim\limits\_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{b^2\_{1,h} \langle \omega^{2 \mu}\rangle}{h} \\\) (note that index \\\(  h \\\) means that parameters were
obtained especially for the time scale in which \\\(  h \\\) is a unit of
time (in general case parameters in GARCH models depend on the selected
time scale)).

The obtained equation is still a separate case of Eq. \[eqref
id="xsde"\], but now it is restricted by \\\(  \lambda = 2\eta \\\). Having in mind that the comparison yields \\\(  2 \eta =\mu \\\), we may expect to control the slope of spectral density by
changing \\\(  \mu \\\):


\begin{equation}
 S(f) \sim \frac{1}{f^\beta} , \quad \beta = 1 +\frac{\lambda - 3}{2 \eta - 2} = 1 + \frac{\mu - 3}{\mu - 2} .
\end{equation}


As you can see [in a figure below](#attachment_2771), it does work
rather well.

The comparison does not explain the roles of \\\(  A \\\) (and thus
\\\(  a\_1 \\\)) and \\\(  C \\\) (and thus \\\(  c\_1 \\\)). Both these
parameters determine the exponential cut-offs of the power law
distribution. Namely stationary distribution of \\\(  y \\\) has the
following form:


\begin{equation}
 p(y) \sim \frac{1}{y^\mu} \exp\left\[ - \frac{2A}{(\mu-1) B^2} \left( \frac{1}{y} \right)^{\mu-1} + \frac{2C}{(\mu-2) B^2} \left(\frac{1}{y}\right)^{\mu-2} \right\] .
\end{equation}


\\\(  A \\\) determines where the exponential cutoff will occur, while
\\\(  C \\\) sets its shape. If \\\(  C \neq 0 \\\), then exponential
"bump" becomes more prominent, while power law tail event becomes less
probable. Indeed, if you are interested in power law distribution and
long-range memory, you should stick with \\\(  C \\\) of the similar
magnitude as \\\(  \pm b^2 \\\). Thus \\\(  c\_1 \\\) should also be
near \\\(  1 \\\) with a possible deviation of similar magnitude as
\\\(  \pm b^2 \\\). If deviations are larger, then Gaussian like
distribution or divergence of the model might be observed.
