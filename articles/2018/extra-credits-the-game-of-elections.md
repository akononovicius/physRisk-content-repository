In the near future We are planning to switch the topic entirely. Not outside the
scope of Physics of Risk, but to a completely different subject within our
scope. Namely, we will move on to cover some of the most well known or otherwise
interesting models of the [opinion dynamics](/tag/opinion-dynamics).

We will kick off this new subject with a series of videos from
[Extra Credits](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg). In
this series they briefly describe the complexity of elections in the US as if
it was well (or not so well) crafted computer game. We invite you to watch it.
