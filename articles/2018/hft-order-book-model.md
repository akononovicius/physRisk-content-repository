We continue our series of posts on [order book models](/tag/order-book/) by
considering an order book model proposed by a group of scientists from Japan
[cite id="Kanazawa2018PRL, Kanazawa2018arxiv, Smart2018PT"], which is based
on high resolution
data from foreign exchange market. Their work is extremely interesting as
it starts from the empirical observations at the lowest level observable and
is built up to reproduce some empirical observations at the higher levels.
Also the model is analytically tractable using [kinetic theory](/tag/kinetic-models/).<!--more-->

## Brief description of the HFT model

The paper which describes the HFT model in detail [cite id="Kanazawa2018arxiv"] is
rather long and involves a lot of sophisticated details explaining why the model
was built as it was. Hence for the sake of brevity we will skip most of the
discussion and mention only essential ideas.

The paper draws analogy between the kinetic theory in Physics and order book
dynamics in Finance. Physical system can be "solved" by going between the three
"hierarchical" description levels: micro-level particle motion (described by the
Liouville equation), meso-level dynamics (described by the Boltzmann equation)
and macro-level tracer particle motion (Brownian motion). The authors claim to
obtain the same hierarchies for the financial markets and show the mathematical
correspondence between the problems. Graphically they explain this idea by the
figure we present to you a bit lower (the figure is a screenshot of the Fig. 1
from the [cite id="Kanazawa2018arxiv"]). This idea provides a background
for the experimental (data analysis) setup as well as analytical treatment
of the model.

![correspondence between the kinetic theory in Physics and order book dynamics in Finance](/uploads/2018/hft-ob-correspondence.png "The main idea of the model as illustrated by Kanazawa et al.")

After performing the empirical analysis of high resolution order-book level data,
the researchers determined four key features of the HFTs (abbr. high-frequency
traders):

1. **HFTs submit small number of live orders and the volume of the orders is small.**
Unlike low-frequency traders HFTs usually submit unit volume limit orders.
1. **HFTs are liquidity providers.** They are required to keep quotes in both bid
and ask sides of the order book.
1. **HFTs frequently modify their quotes.** The researchers report that typical
transaction interval was 9.3 seconds in their data set, while the quotes were
typically modified within a second intervals.
1. **HFTs follow recent price trends.** On average HFTs modify their quotes by:

\\\[ \\langle \\Delta q \\rangle \\approx c\_i \\tanh \\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta p\_i^{\*}} . \\\]

Having in mind these four observations the researchers consider a fixed number \\\( N \\\)
of agents (representing HFTs) who submit both bid and ask limit orders. As agents submit
to the both sides of the order book they can be characterized by their bid and ask quotes
(\\\( b\_i \\\) and \\\( a\_i \\\) respectively) or by their own mid-price and spread
(\\\( z\_i = \( b\_i + a\_i \) /2 \\\) and \\\( L\_i = b\_i - a\_i \\\) respectively). The second
choice is more convenient as then we have only one temporal random variable \\\( z\_i \\\),
while \\\( L\_i \\\) can be treated as an agents intrinsic property (also sampled randomly
for each different agent, but constant in respect to time).

Empirical analysis shows that \\\( L\_i \\\) is distributed according the Gamma
distribution with shape parameter \\\( \alpha+1 \\\) equal to \\\( 4 \\\) and
scale parameter \\\( L^{\*} \\\) equal to \\\( 15.5 \\\). Without inputting these
numbers the PDF of agent spread, \\\( L\_i \\\), has the following form:

\\\[ p\( L \) = \\frac{L^{\\alpha}}{ \\Gamma\(\\alpha+1\) L^{\*\(\\alpha+1\)}} \\exp\\left\( - \\frac{L}{L^{\*}} \\right\). \\\]

Requotation due to recent prices trends (fourth observation) is included into
the model as stochastic differential equation describing the motion of
each agent's mid-price \\\( z\_i \\\):

\\\[ \\mathrm{d} z\_i = c \\tanh \\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta p^{\*}} \\mathrm{d} t + \\sigma \\mathrm{d} W , \\\]

here the three parameters \\\( c \\\), \\\( \\Delta p^{\*} \\\) and \\\( \\sigma \\\)
ought to be different for each agent, but without loss of generality we can set them
to identical typical values for all agents. Note that \\\( \\Delta p \\\) changes
discretely in time (each time transaction occurs its value is reset).

Finally we have to define "transaction rule" -- how the quotes change after the
transaction occurs. Lets assume that transaction has occurred, because the following
match was found:

\\\[ b\_j = a\_i . \\\]

After the transaction a new price is set \\\( p = \( b\_j + a\_i\) /2 \\\) and price
trend indicator value is set to \\\( \\Delta p = p^{new} - p^{old} \\\). After this
the traders are assumed to requote their orders simultaneously by setting their
mid-prices to the transaction price. This induces a momentary movement of agent's \\\( j \\\)
quotes by \\\( - L\_j/2 \\\) and agent's \\\( i \\\) quotes by \\\( L\_i /2 \\\).

To visually understand how the model behaves see an illustration by Kanazawa et al.
below (the figure is a screenshot of Fig. 4 from the [cite id="Kanazawa2018arxiv"]).

## Weak, strong and marginal trend following regimes

This model exhibits three distinct behavioral regimes based on how much impact
trend following has. The strength of trend following is well captured by the
\\\( \\tilde c \\\) parameter, which depends on the model parameters as follows [cite id="Kanazawa2018PRL, Kanazawa2018arxiv"]:

\\\[ {\\tilde c} =\\frac{c L^{\*} \\sqrt{\\alpha \(\\alpha-1\)}}{\\sigma^2 \\sqrt{2 N}} . \\\]

As the model is based on empirical observations Kanazawa et al. [cite id="Kanazawa2018PRL, Kanazawa2018arxiv"]
estimated the parameter values from their data set. These values are the default ones
in the figures (app screenshots) and app below: \\\( c = 6 \\\), \\\( \\Delta p^{\*} = 7.5 \\\) ,
\\\( \\sigma=3.8 \\\) (authors do report a different value, but I believe that
this is a mistype on their part as in that case \\\( \\tilde c \\\) value would
not be a correct one), \\\( \\alpha=3 \\\) and \\\( L^{\*}=15.5 \\\). We have used
\\\( N = 100 \\\) in all our simulations, which consistent with the data set
used in the original paper.

If \\\( \\tilde c \\\) is significantly smaller than 1, then trend following is weak.
In this case diffusive behavior of the HFTs dominates, hence the price change
distribution is approximately Gaussian. Auto-correlation function for the short lags
is noticeably negative.

![weak trend following](/uploads/2018/hft-ob-weak.png "Weak trend following (default parameters, except \\\( \\sigma=14.5 \\\)).")

If \\\( \\tilde c \\\) would be significantly larger than 1, then trend following is
strong. In this case drift behavior of the HFTs dominates. The price change PDF
is exponential, while auto-correlation function for the short lags is noticeably
positive. The auto-correlation function in our app below is positive, if last
1024 time ticks (points) include at least one trend reversal. If the current trend
persists for longer than 1024 points, then auto-correlation function will fluctuate
around zero. This is just minor artifact of the algorithm we implemented in the app.

![strong trend following](/uploads/2018/hft-ob-strong.png "Strong trend following (default parameters, except \\\( \\sigma=1.8 \\\)).")

If \\\( {\\tilde c} \\approx 1 \\\), then trend following is marginal. In this case
we observe interplay between the drift and diffusion terms of the HFTs. The price
change PDF is exponential. While the auto-correlation function will fluctuate around
zero. For some parameter sets it will favor negative side, for some -- positive side.

![marginal trend following](/uploads/2018/hft-ob-marginal.png "Marginal trend following (default parameters).")

The empirical estimates point to the third case. The paper reports that marginal
following case is also consistent with empirical facts (price change PDF and
auto-correlation for the short times).

## Interactive applets

To understand the model and its dynamics better you should study the interactive
applets below.

The first applet, as has become usual, shows us how the structure of the order
book evolves as the time goes on. Note that unlike in most other cases here we
have relative price on the x axis, thus negative "prices" will also be observed.
Also note that this model uses continuous prices, hence the plot below shows
a number of submitted limit orders in the interval \\\( \[ p, p+1 \) \\\). Note
that the shape of the both sides of the order book is symmetric and has shape
similar to the log-normal distribution (similarly as in the
[previously discussed model]({filename}/articles/2018/preis-order-book-model.md)),
but the true expression is different [cite id="Kanazawa2018PRL, Kanazawa2018arxiv"].

The second applet is in certain sense traditional Physics of Risk applet for all
financial market models. Only now every plot was changed somewhat to show the
important feature of this model.

First of all this model uses relative price instead of log-price or price and
"price change" instead of returns. Relative price is measured as a distance in
price ticks from some arbitrarily selected "zero" level. "Price change",
\\\( \\Delta p \\\) is measured as a difference between relative prices at two
different points in time (the temporal distance, \\\( \\Delta t \\\), between
these points is kept constant for consistency).

This model exhibits statistical properties which are different from the ones
we are usually interested in. In this model the price change is distributed
either normally or exponentially (depending on the parameter values), hence
the PDF plot features log-linear axes instead of log-log axis we usually use.

Also instead of plotting power spectral density we plot auto-correlation,
\\\( C \( \\tau \) \\\), function of the price change. \\\( C \( 0 \) \\\)
will be always equal to 1, but other nearby values will behave different depending
on the parameter values. For the sake of speed, we consider only 1024 last
time series points when calculating auto-correlation function, so some
"artifacts" may appear. Note that we show two curves, which will most of the time
over lap. The blue curve shows auto-correlation of the price change time series,
while the yellow curve shows auto-correlation of the absolute price change time
series.
