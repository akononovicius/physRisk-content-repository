Couple of months ago I have started a [series of posts](/tag/price-formation-series/) on price formation in the free market or how and why the free market does (not) work.

In the [first part]({filename}/articles/2017/paklausos-ir-pasiulos-desniai.md) of the series we have discussed economic laws of supply and demand. We have learned that the cheaper the product is the more people will be willing to buy it. Also that the more people are willing to pay for the product, the more of the product will be produced.

In the [second part]({filename}/articles/2018/price-formation-printing-press.md) we have discussed a simple example in which printing press failed to predict the demand for the book. We have discussed how non-optimal prices emerge as a result of this miscalculation.

In the [third part]({filename}/articles/2018/cobweb-model.md) of the series we have discussed the implications of the cobweb model, which attempts to explain how the prices and produced quantity converge to equilibrium. We have noted that this convergence is not immediate and may take some time.

In the [fourth part]({filename}/articles/2018/price-formation-game-theory.md) we have looked into the price formation from game theory perspective. We discussed why competition should emerge and why it might not. We had also discussed some interesting implications of the ["price war" game]({filename}/articles/2018/price-war-game.md), which highlight crucial importance of the competition.

Through out this series of posts we have discussed few simple models lying behind the idea of free markets. We have discussed the assumptions, which are made and which must hold for the free markets to produce desirable outcome. From these posts, and many others on Physics of Risk, we should have obtained a good understanding that self-organization does not always result in a "good" (desired) outcome.

## Should we turn towards economic nationalism?

SPOILER: No. Hell NO!

To understand why economic nationalism is even worse idea let us imagine the core idea behind the economic nationalism at a personal level. Namely, the idea would be that each person should be self-sustaining, he should produce the food he eats, make his own clothes, build his own house and do everything else by himself without any outside help. Imagine your own standard of living in such world. The train of thought is the same at the larger scale as well.

Let us examine historical examples of economic nationalism. There are two excellent examples both "occurring" approximately at the same time. Both Japanese Empire and British Empire in the XVIIth century decided that foreign trade and influence is bad for the nation and turned to economic nationalism.

From 1630s to 1850s Japan isolated itself from the rest of the world banning almost all foreign trade (with exception of couple of ports, which were open to ships from several countries). By the end of the isolation period Japanese people still lived as in 1640s. Japan was lagging behind the Western countries by 200 years. After the Meiji restoration (which ended the isolation period) Japan managed to catch up with the rest of the World in less than 50 years. By the First World War Japan became a major power.

British Empire isolated itself by imposing huge tariffs on some of the imported goods. This raised prices as well as created the need for the nation to expand. The expansion was necessary so that the country could produce everything its citizens needed. As a result British Empire was at one time the largest country in the world. Also we could attribute [the Great Famine in Ireland of 1840s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_%28Ireland%29) (1 million people died, 1 million people immigrated) to the high tariff policy. At the same time all of the Europe suffered from the potato blight, but it hit Ireland the hardest, because the food prices in the British Empire were heavily inflated by the protectionist [Corn laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_Laws). England suffered less as the Corn laws were beneficial for this part of the Empire. Repealing Corn laws lead to the decrease of the food prices and as a result it improved the standard of living of the poorer classes.

Economic nationalism stifles the competition between the suppliers. Hence the supply curve can more easily shift to the left. Obviously this leads to an increase in consumer prices and as a result the business owners prosper (as they can reap larger profits) while the consumers languish. This means that economic inequality increases. Also, as per the example of Japanese Empire, the nation's standard of living stops growing as fast as in the rest of the world.

## So what should we do?

Debate between the free market ideology and economic nationalists suggests that these are the only two possible choices. But such claims are [wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma). We are not forced to choose between two alternatives, we should figure out a reasonable middle (or even "perpendicular") way. We should approach economics as a complex system. We should understand that models work and fail for some reasons, which need to be understood. The key to this is understanding that the reasons lie in the assumptions of the models. As the assumption are violated, the models fail.

Having all of this in mind it is rather easy to conclude that we must stay with the free markets, but we must adjust our understanding of what that means. Anarchism as well as strict regulation will definitely fail, thus reasonable regulation (guided by science and not ideological BS) is a must.

While it is hard to provide exact policy suggestions, the primary goal should be promoting competition between the market participants. This could be done by making market information transparent, freely and easily available. By making it easier for new competitors to enter and deter existing competitors from going into price wars with new ones. Though it is worth to note that there already are a lot bad examples of trying to achieve this with simplistic means (see John Oliver's video below). It is extremely important for governments to be subtle, to regulate and to create good incentives for the market participants.
