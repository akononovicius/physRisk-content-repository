There is an interesting phenomenon concerning behavior
of ant colony. It appears that if there are two identical food sources
nearby, ants exploit only one of them at a given time. The interesting
thing is that used food source is not certain at any point of time. At
some times switch between food sources occur though the quality of food
sources remains the same. In 1993 Alan Kirman proposed that this could
happen due to importance of herding behavior in ant colonies \[cite
id="Kirman1993QJE"\].<!--more-->

Supposedly fraction of ants act on their own - they randomly search for
new food sources. If food source is found ants, which found it, share
this information among the other workers within the same colony. At the
time information is obtained every worker can decide which of the two
food sources he should use. As food sources are qualitatively the same
the only differing factor is number of ants using the resource. Thus
decision is made based on the preferences of herd.

Similar mechanics are covered in Kirman's ant colony model. But the
application of the model is not limited to ants or other animals! Kirman
as an economist developed this model as framework in context of economic
modeling (see \[cite id="Kirman1993QJE"\] and his later bibliography).
This framework is also widely used by other authors who model financial
markets (see \[cite id="Alfarano2005CompEco, Alfarano2008Dyncon"\]).

Mathematics behind the model
----------------------------

Let us assume that we have ant colony with \\\(  N \\\) ants. Let us
place, near modeled colony, two identical food sources. Thus at any
given time some ants, \\\(  x \\\), gather food from one food resource,
while the other resource is harvested by \\\(  N-x \\\) ants. As knowing
number of ants using one food source gives us all relevant information
about the modeled system, we can choose \\\(  x \\\) as variable
describing system state.

By assuming that ants select food source depending on individual opinion
about food source, \\\(  \sigma\_i \\\), and herding, \\\(  h \\\), for
relatively short time intervals, \\\(  \Delta t \\\), we can write
probabilities for minimal changes of system state:


\begin{equation}
 p(x \rightarrow x+1) = (N - x) (\sigma\_1 + h x) \Delta t ,
\end{equation}



\begin{equation}
 p(x \rightarrow x-1) = x (\sigma\_2 + h (N-x))\Delta t .
\end{equation}


In the equations above \\\(  \sigma\_i \\\), individual behavior, terms
are multiplied by population once, accordingly by \\\(  x \\\) and
\\\(  (N-x) \\\), as individual transitions rates should depend only on
number of ants using other food source. In case of ant colony and two
identical food sources simpler case \\\(  \sigma\_1 = \sigma\_2 =\sigma \\\) is more realistic, but to keep equations as general as
possible we keep \\\(  \sigma\_i \\\) values different. Choosing
different values would mean that one of the food sources is better or
otherwise preferred.

Herding, \\\(  h \\\), terms are a bit more complex as interaction
transition rates depend on numbers both of both recruitees and
recruiters, \\\(  x (N-x) \\\). Alternatively one can see herding
transition mechanism as drawing two colored balls from the box -
probability to draw two differently colored balls depends on numbers of
colored balls inside the box.

How short time intervals \\\(  \Delta t \\\) should be? There can be
lots of differing answers, but generally times should as short as it
must be for sum of transition probabilities, \\\(  p(x \rightarrow x+1) \\\) and \\\(  p(x \rightarrow x-1) \\\), to be smaller than one.
Mathematically we can rewrite this requirement as


\begin{equation}
 \Delta t&lt;\frac{1}{(N - x) \sigma\_1 + x \sigma\_2 + 2 h N(N-x)} , 
\end{equation}


as probabilities are largest at \\\(  x=N/2 \\\) we can further simplify
this expression to


\begin{equation}
 \Delta t&lt;\frac{2}{N (\sigma\_1 + \sigma\_2 + h N)}\simeq \frac{2}{h N^2} . 
\end{equation}


Different quality of evolution observed in model
------------------------------------------------

In this section we will experiment with different parameter values and
thus show different possible evolutions, which can be observed in
Kirman's ant model.

As one could expect, if herding is weak, \\\(  \sigma\_1 \approx\sigma\_2 \gg h  \\\), system state fluctuates around some intermediate
value (see [Fig 1.](#attachment_547)). In such case agents do not
organize themselves into groups - they make individual decisions. As
herding is not important in this case, intermediate value around which
fluctuations occur depends on the ratio of \\\(  \sigma\_1 \\\) and
\\\(  \sigma\_2 \\\).

\\\( \sigma_1 = \sigma_2 =1 \\\))."){#attachment_547} 

In other extreme case, \\\(  \sigma\_1 \approx \sigma\_2 \ll h  \\\),
system behaves differently - most of ants at any given point of time use
only one food source (see [Fig. 2.](#attachment_546)). At some times
switches between food sources occur. Interestingly enough weak
individualism plays major role in observed dynamics as switches occur
due to majority of ants choosing to follow individualists. If we turn
off individualism within the system, it's state will converge to stable
states at \\\(  x=0 \\\) or \\\(  x=N \\\) - there will be no further
fluctuations.

\\\( \sigma_1 = \sigma_2 =1 \\\))."){#attachment_546} 

Dynamics in the extreme cases illustrate mostly single one mechanism
behind the model, thus most interesting behavior can be observed in
between. If two different behavior mechanics are balanced, \\\(  h\approx \sigma\_1 \approx \sigma\_2  \\\), agents at the same time tend
to form groups and act on their own accord. Interestingly in such case
entropy of the system is at it's or near it's maximum as probabilities
of observing each system state are very similar (see [Fig
3](#attachment_548).).

\\\( \sigma_1 = \sigma_2 =1\\\))."){#attachment_548} 

In all previous examples behavior of the system is symmetrical - neither
food source is preffered, \\\(  \sigma\_1 \approx \sigma\_2 \\\). But
what happens if one of the food sources is preferred, say \\\( \sigma\_1 &gt; \sigma\_2 \\\)? As one would expect in such case
probability density function maxima moves a bit towards larger system
state, \\\(  x \\\), values. This means that first food source, the one
which is exploited by \\\(  x \\\) ants, becomes preferred and is used
more frequently than the other one (see [Fig 4.](#attachment_551)).

Applet
------

In the previous section of this article it was shown that \\\( \Delta t \\\) values must be limited from the above in order for model
equations to have mathematically correct interpretation. In the program
below we have chosen to use one of the previous inequalities to define
actual value of \\\(  \Delta t \\\):


\begin{equation}
 \Delta t = \frac{2 \kappa}{N (\sigma\_1 + \sigma\_2 + h N)}, 
\end{equation}


note that here parameter \\\(  \kappa \\\) has appeared. This parameter
is responsible for precision of the calculations and allows user to
fulfill requirements set by the previous inequalities for \\\( \Delta t \\\) - one just need to set \\\(  \kappa \\\) value to 1 or other
smaller positive number. In most of the cases \\\(  \kappa \approx1 \\\) will suffice.

If you came here to find the previously used Java applet, it is still
available
[here](/uploads/models/old-java/kirman-ants-en.html).
The functionality of both, new HTML5 and old Java, applets is almost
identical.
