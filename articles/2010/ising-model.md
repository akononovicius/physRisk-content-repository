*Ising model* is a generalized mathematical model of
feromagnetism in statistical physics. In this model particles having
magnetic spin are put inside vertices of graph. In general case
structure of graph can vary alot, but in the ussuall case selection is
limited to the lattices of different dimensions. Behavior of such system
is observed at different temperature in the quest to find critical
temperature at which phase shift occurs. If you want to familarize
yourself more with Ising model and it's various interpretations, you
should read \[cite id="Baxter1982Academic, Sethna2009Clarendon"\] works,
because in this text we will only consider one possible, numerical,
algorithm - heat bath algorithm.

Note that this model is not only applicable towards common problems of
Statistical Physics, but it also has many different interdisciplinary
applications. It is true as one can put
[agents](/tag/agent-based-models), generalized
objects immitating seemingly human behavior, into the vertices of the
[graph](/network-models). Thus one could
analyze herding behavior in human inhabited systems (see for ex. \[cite
id="Bornholdt2001IJMPC, Kaizoji2002PhysA, Yook2008JKPS"\]).

About the model
---------------

Hamiltonian of system, whose every particle can interact with other
particles and with the external magnetic field, can be expressed as


\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{H} = - \frac{1}{2} \sum\limits\_{j \neq i=1}^{N}J\_{i,j} \vec S\_i \vec S\_j - \vec H \sum\limits\_{i=1}^{N} \vec S\_i , 
\end{equation}


here \\\(  J\_{i,j}  \\\) - strenght of interaction between two
particles, \\\(  \vec S\_i \\\) - spin of the particle, \\\(  \vec H \\\) - external magnetic field.

The above Hamiltonian is very general, thus it is simplified by making
some assumptions. First it is required that spins of the modelic
particles can align themselves in parallel to the selected axis, thus
\\\(  \vec S\_i \\\) projection on to that axis, \\\(  s\_i \\\), can
only be equal to \\\(  \pm 1 \\\). If the requirement is fulfilled, then
only the projection, \\\(  h \\\), of the external magentic field,
\\\(  \vec H \\\), has to be considered. Also note that strength of
interaction between two particles should decrease with the increasing
distance between them - thus in the simplest case one can assume that
particle interacts only with it's immeadiate neighbors. In case of 2D
lattice, structure we chose, particle has 4 immeadiate neighbors. Thus
now we can reexpress Hamiltonian as


\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{H\_{2D}} = - J \sum\limits\_{x,y} s\_{x,y} \left(s\_{x+1,y} + s\_{x,y+1} \right) - h \sum\limits\_{x,y} s\_{x,y} ,
\end{equation}


here \\\(  x  \\\) and \\\(  y  \\\) are coordinates on 2D lattice
(summations in the above Hamiltonian is made over all possible \\\(  x \\\) and \\\(  y  \\\) values). In the original Ising model value of
\\\(  J \\\) is fixed and equal to 1 - modeled matter is assumed to have
feromagnetic properties below critical temperature and paragmentic
above. Thus we could drop \\\(  J \\\) from the above Hamiltonian, but it
is kept as in the applet below we have also implemented opposite,
antiferomagnetic (\\\(  J = -1 \\\)), case. Though antiferomagnetic case
is not very interesting as phase shift is not observed.

Temperature is introduced into the model by implementing heat bath. Each
selected particle is connected to the heat bath. Afterward joint system
is allowed to reach thermal equilibrium. Thus new state of the particle,
direction of it's spin, is chosen based on Boltzmann distribution -
probability to observe system state with energy \\\(  E \\\) is
proportional to \\\(  \exp \left(- \frac{E}{k T} \right) \\\).

Phases and phase shift in Ising model
-------------------------------------

From the introduction of temperature in to the model it should be
evident that model will behave differently at different temperatures -
two different phases will be observed. Disorder will dominate in case of
high temperature as particles will increase their own energy using
thermal energy. While if temperature is low, thermal energy is also low,
thus particles will not be able to increase their energy - particles
will try to obtain minimal energy. In this orderly phase at first same
spin domains will form and grow, while finally in the end one spin will
dominate whole lattice. Most interesting behavior is observed at
intermediate, critical, temperature - aforementioned two behaviors are
balanced and forming orderly domains are continously being destroyed by
random spin flips. Bellow in [Fig. 1](#attachment_994) we present
typical lattice snapshots at different temperatures.

In order to numerically estimate critical temperature one must check a
range of temperatures and observe how magnetization and system energy
change. Bellow in [Fig. 2](#attachment_995) we demonstrate how the
aforementioned observables change with changing model parameter \\\( \frac{\Delta E}{k T} \\\) (\\\(  \frac{\Delta \mathcal{H}}{k T} =\frac{\Delta E}{k T} J \sum\limits\_{\langle i , j \rangle} s\_js\_i  \\\)), which is actually inverse temperature measured as energy
in terms of spin energy. As we see from the figure phase shift occurs in
the interval \\\(  0.3 &lt; \left( \frac{\Delta E}{k T} \right)\_c&lt; 0.5  \\\).

values."){#attachment_995} 

Previously we assumed that there is no external magnetic field. But how
would observed model behavior change if external magnetic field is
present? The answer is given in h-1/T phase diagram below (see [Fig.
3](#attachment_1010)) - external magnetic field aligns most of the spins
in one direction (same as the direction of magnetic field).

direction dominates (s=1 (red) or s=-1 (blue)) due to the external
magnetic field, paramagnetism is observed near \\\( h=0 \\\) and \\\( T > T_c \\\)
(magenta area), feromagnetism is observed near \\\( h=0 \\\) and \\\( T < T_c \\\) (area
colored in red-blue stripes). Critical behavior area around h=0 and
\\\( T=T_c \\\) (green

HTML5 Applet
------------

In the applet below we present implementation of Ising model on 50x50
2D square lattice. In the applet window you can see four figures -
current spatial spin distribution graph, evolution of energy, entropy
and magnetization. Single iteration corresponds to the one thousand
attempts to change the spin of the random particle. After every
iteration each figure is renewed. Numerical calculations are started by
pressing button "Start" and can be stopped by pressing button "Stop".
After stopping the calculations user can resume them or restart them
from the beginning.

If you came here to find the previously used Java applet, it is still
available
[here](/uploads/models/old-java/ising-en.html). The
functionality of both applets is almost identical.
