Time series obtained by solving
non-linear stochastic models exhibit rather interesting statistical
properties. On Physics of Risk we have already discussed some of these
models \[cite id="Gontis2010Intech, Kononovicius2012PhysA"\] (ex.
[stochastic model of
return](/long-range-memory-stochastic-model-return "Long-range memory stochastic model of return on Physics of Risk"),
[herding model of financial
markets](/agent-based-herding-model-financial-markets "Agent based herding model of financial markets on Physics of Risk")),
which are able to reproduce statistical properties of high frequency
return (namely spectral density and probability distribution).

In statistical sense model and financial market behavior might be
studied in many different manners. One may study probability
distributions, moments, spectral densities, autocorrelations and etc.,
using each of them to obtain vital information on the statistical and
dynamical properties of the studied system. It is important to note that
new useful information might be provided by the statistical indicators,
which are related to the previously used indicators in unambiguous
manner. One may also introduce new variables describing system itself or
its time series.

There is a group of such variables, which is closely related to the
estimation of risk, known as *burst statistics* \[cite
id="Alaburda2011JDySES, Kaulakys2009AIP"\]. In this text we will discuss
these variables and their statistical properties. At the end of the text
we also present interactive java applet, using which one can reproduce
burst statistics of certain stochastic model.<!--more-->

Burst statistics
----------------

Before analyzing burst statistics we have first to define what these
burst are. Evidently burst is a cluster of larger values in the time
series, thus we must define some threshold value and assume that every
point above it belong to burst. We denote threshold value as h
(abbreviation of "height"). In [Fig. 1](#attachment_1854) we have also
marked three threshold passage events - start of the example burst, end
of the example burst, start of the next to the example burst. These
three events will be further referenced then introducing variables
schematically introduced in [Fig. 1](#attachment_1854).

![image](/uploads/2011/08/bursts_time_series.png "Variables related to the burst statistics: h -
threshold value; τ - waiting time; T - burst duration; S - burst size; θ
- inter-burst
time."){#attachment_1854} 

As you can see in [Fig. 1](#attachment_1854) we have denoted time window
between first and third event as τ. We will call τ waiting time as it
tells us the times between two successive bursts. Time interval between
second and third event, θ, is similar variable, but it describes
inter-burst times. Burst duration, time between first and second events,
is denoted as T, while burst size, defined as area between threshold
line and time series curve (cyan area in [Fig. 1](#attachment_1854)), is
assigned symbol S (abbreviation of "size").

It is known that probability densities of τ, T and θ, obtained from
non-linear stochastic models, can be fitted by power law. Furthermore it
is known that characteristic burst size is proportional to the power of
burst duration \[cite id="Alaburda2011JDySES, Kaulakys2009AIP"\].
Numerical evaluation of simple non-linear stochastic model,


\begin{equation}
 \mathrm{d} x = \left ( \eta - \frac{\lambda}{2} \right)\left( 1+x^2 \right)^{\eta-1} x \mathrm{d} t + \left( 1+x^2\right)^{\frac{\eta}{2}} \mathrm{d} W , \label{sde}
\end{equation}


provides \\\(  S \propto T^2  \\\), \\\(  p(\tau) \sim\tau^{-1.5}  \\\), \\\(  p(T) \sim T^{-1.4}  \\\), \\\( p(\theta) \sim \theta^{-1.4}  \\\) relations, where p is
probability density function of certain variable. It was shown that
these relations hold for \\\(  \eta \geq 1 \\\) case \[cite
id="Kaulakys2009AIP"\] and are very similar, power law nature is
retained, but powers themselves slightly differ, in \\\(  \eta &lt;1 \\\) case \[cite id="Alaburda2011JDySES"\]. Bellow, see [Fig.
2](#attachment_1881), we have shown typical results obtained by using
interactive Java applet provided at [the end of this text](#java).

Eq. \[eqref id="sde"\] was derived while looking for stochastic model
capable of reproducing empirical statistical properties of high
frequency return \[cite id="Gontis2010Intech"\] (see [the corresponding
text on Physics of
Risk](/long-range-memory-stochastic-model-return#simple "Langevin equation with q-Gaussian stationary distribution")).
Though this equation is simpler than final one, it is still able to
reproduce power law distribution and long-range memory of return. Thus
analysis of this equation in terms of burst statistics might provide
useful insights for risk management.

This presumptuous conclusion might be backed by empirical analysis. As
solutions of Eq. \[eqref id="sde"\] have spectral density similar to the
empirical spectral density, it is to be expected that empirical data
should also have similar burst statistics. Indeed as you can see in
[Fig. 3](#attachment_1884) empirical data, we have analyzed 26 different
stocks traded on New York Stock Change from January 2005 to March 2007,
has similar burst statistics:

-   In sub-figure [(a)](#attachment_1884) we have presented burst size
    versus burst duration plot. Different symbols correspond to
    different stocks (we have used 9 randomly selected stocks). As you
    can see symbols of all stocks lie in same region with little or no
    difference in positioning visible. Empirical data in this figure was
    fitted as power law, \\\(  S \propto T^{1.94}  \\\).
-   In sub-figure [(b)](#attachment_1884) we have plotted average,
    averaged over 26 stocks, τ probability density function. Empirical
    data once again can be fitted by power law, \\\(  p(\tau) \sim    \tau^{-1.47}  \\\).
-   In sub-figure [(c)](#attachment_1884) we have plotted average,
    averaged over 26 stocks, T probability density function. Empirical
    data once again can be fitted by power law, \\\(  p(T) \sim    T^{-1.46}  \\\).
-   In sub-figure [(d)](#attachment_1884) we have plotted average,
    averaged over 26 stocks, θ probability density function. Empirical
    data once again can be fitted by power law, \\\(  p(\theta) \sim    \theta^{-1.52}  \\\).

We have obtained results presented in [Fig. 3](#attachment_1884) by
analyzing one minute absolute return time series. All analyzed time
series were filtered using one hour moving average filter prior to
analysis. We have set burst threshold value to 1, h=1.

    <p>Above this text you might see a Java applet. Though you might not see it as Java is more-or-less a dying web technology. Namely, most likely you have not installed Java Runtime Environment on your computer, or your browser prevents JRE plugin from running. You could try installing the most recent JRE and/or enabling JRE plugin in your browser, but we do not advise to do this as this might not help and this could cause potential security risks. Please be patient - some day we possibly will update this article with HTML5 applet. If you have programming skills, you may dowload jar archive and open it - inside you'll find the source code for the applet. Feel free to use it.</p>
