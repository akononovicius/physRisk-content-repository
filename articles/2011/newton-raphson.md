Newton-Raphson, sometimes just Newton or
Newton-Fourier, method is an approximate method in mathematical analysis
for finding local roots of very complex functions (such as polynomials
with large powers). Recall that root of the function is defined as a
solution of \\\(  f(z) = 0 \\\). The essence of this method is to
linearize function at the guessing point. The point where linearized
function passes the abscissa axis is assumed to be a more precise
estimate of the actual root.<!--more--> Mathematically:


\begin{equation}
 z\_{n+1} = z\_n - \frac{f(z\_n)}{f'(z\_n)}, 
\end{equation}


here \\\(  z\_n \\\) is our previous guess (also the point of
linearization). n-th guess of the root is assumed to be precise enough
if \\\(  | z\_{n} - z\_{n-1} | &lt; \varepsilon \\\) (here \\\( \varepsilon \\\) is allowable error). Note that if n-th guess matches root
precisely (t.y. \\\(  f(z\_\infty)=0 \\\)) error equals zero, \\\(  |z\_{n} - z\_{n-1} | = 0 \\\).

Simple example
--------------

Let us solve \\\(  x^2 + 2 x +1 = 0  \\\) (\\\(  f(x)=x^2+2 x+1 \\\), \\\(  f'(x)=2 x+ 2 \\\), \\\(  \frac{f(x)}{f'(x)} =\frac{1+x}{2} \\\)):

Iteration  |n-th root  |f(z)/f'(z)  |n+1-th root  |Error
-----------|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------
1          |-2         |-0.5        |-1.5         |0.5
2          |-1.5       |-0.25       |-1.25        |0.25
3          |-1.25      |-0.125      |-1.125       |0.125
4          |-1.125     |-0.0625     |-1.0625      |0.0625
5          |-1.06258   |-0.03125    |-1.03125     |0.03125

Here we can stop by assuming that our allowable error \\\( \varepsilon = 0.04 \\\).

Application towards complex numbers
-----------------------------------

As we know polynomial with n-th power has n roots. The problem is that
not all of them can be real valued! In such case one will have to search
complex number plane. If one is willing to find more than one root one
should make more than guess. These two requirements can be solved rather
simply. One just should take some region of the complex plane and skim
through it at some fixed step. Each step corresponds to making new guess
from the associated, smaller, region. By coloring these regions
according to the success of the guess on would obtain map. These maps
tend to have fractal structure and thus are known as Newton-Raphson
fractals.

In the image bellow you see solution of \\\(  z^2+2 \imath z+1=0 \\\) one the complex plane (real and imaginary parts are constrained
in \[-5;5\]).

While this image is not breathtaking, it is perfect for understanding of
the method - in it you can clearly see how different guesses converge
towards roots. Brighter regions mean that root is found faster, while
different colors belong to the different final roots.

Complex cases and root basins
-----------------------------

Let see how method fares in case of more complex equation - \\\( z^5+z^3+2 \imath z+1=0  \\\). Let the real part of expected roots
be constrained in \[0;5\], while imaginary being in \[-0.25;1.75\]. In
the image bellow we can see three different roots. Though only one is
seen fully, while the others are seen only partly (via basins).

But what happens near the edge of basin?

![edge of basin](/uploads/2011/05/fig1b.png)

As we can see interesting thing happen on the edge - many small basins
are attached to the larger one. Attachment should persist at different
scales meaning that even smaller basins are attached to the smaller
basins. Interestingly enough neither of basins has root inside them
(thus "jumps" to the other places on the complex plain occur in the eyes
of each basin).

![another edge](/uploads/2011/05/fig1c.png)

Let's analyze one more complex case - \\\(  z^7+15 z^4+3=0  \\\).
Let real and imaginary part of roots be constrained in \[-5;5\]. This we
can clearly see six different roots, while seventh is hardly seen as it
is the only real root and convergence towards it is very slow.

Bellow you can see the case then two different basins "interact" with
each other.

In the image bellow you can see small root basins overlapping. Note that
even smaller root basins are overlapping. These overlaps would persist
at any scale.

Newton-Raphson fractal generator
--------------------------------

We have called this fractal generator NeRFEx (abbrevation from *Ne*wton
*R*aphson *F*ractal *Ex*plorer). Note that Java applet has some
functions disabled, those functions are made available in standalone
java program (you can download it's
[English](/uploads/2011/05/NeRFExEn.jar)
or
[Lithuanian](/uploads/2011/05/NeRFExLt.jar)
localization).

To start working with fractal generator press "Open NeRFEx in new
window". Pop-up shall open and you'll be see main GUI of NeRFEx.

    <p>Above this text you might see a Java applet. Though you might not see it as Java is more-or-less a dying web technology. Namely, most likely you have not installed Java Runtime Environment on your computer, or your browser prevents JRE plugin from running. You could try installing the most recent JRE and/or enabling JRE plugin in your browser, but we do not advise to do this as this might not help and this could cause potential security risks. Please be patient - some day we possibly will update this article with HTML5 applet. If you have programming skills, you may dowload jar archive and open it - inside you'll find the source code for the applet. Feel free to use it.</p>
