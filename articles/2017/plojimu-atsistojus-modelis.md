It has been a long time
since last interactive model on Physics of Risk. This time we return to
a problem [we have already previously
considered](/statistical-physics-a-key-to-understanding-of-the-social-and-economic-complexity),
but which we did not model.

From time to time almost everyone of us has an opportunity to go see a
play. Afterwards everyone has to make a choice - to applaud or not to.
It appears to be free choice, but actually it isn't as there are various
social feedback loops in play. This problem was considered as a simple
agent-based model in a paper by Miller and Page \[cite
id="Miller2004Complexity"\]. In this text we will briefly introduce you
to it.<!--more-->

The model
---------

Imagine we have a square auditorium of certain size (it is choosable in
the app below). All of the chair in the auditorium are taken by agents,
who have to decide to join standing ovation (green) or not to (red). Of
course in real world people would eventually leave the auditorium (and
ones who have not liked the play earlier), but for the sake of
simplicity we assume that agents do not leave the auditorium.

Initial agent's decision is determined solely by how much the agent
likes the play. This "likeability" is an internal parameter, which
differs for all agents and which is drawn from uniform distribution
(restricted in \\\(  \[0,1\] \\\)). Yet the stand up threshold is a
global model parameter, \\\(  T \\\). The larger \\\(  T \\\), the less
agents will stand up. The internal "likeability," in the app below is
shown by adjusting luminosity of the colors (the darker the color is,
the less agent likes the play).

But the "likeability" matters only during the first step. Afterwards
each agents looks at his neighbors. If the agent sees that majority of
his neighbors do the opposite thing, then to avoid feeling uncomfortable
he will change his behavior. Namely if majority of neighbors are
applauding, then the agent will also join applause. If majority of
neighbors are sitting silently, then he will also sit. The model has an
important catch - one agent can see only limited amount of other agents.
His field of view is limited (see figure below).

Here we would like to draw your attention to one slightly unrealistic
assumption we have made. Our auditorium uses periodic boundary
conditions (alternatively, it is a toroid). Namely agents sitting in
front see the agents sitting in the back. Ones sitting leftmost see the
agents sitting rightmost. While it is impossible in reality, this
assumption is common in physics to avoid "boundary effects".

Also we would like to note that in our implementation agents update
their behavior synchronously.

The dynamics
------------

Using the same parameter set \\\(  T=0.5 \\\) ir \\\(  r=1 \\\) we have
reproduced all possible outcomes of the model - whole auditorium
ovation, periodic ovation and silent auditorium.

![total applause](/uploads/2017/02/som-visi-ploja.png "After some time all
agents have joined standing ovation (green curve is at 1). No agents feel
uncomfortable (black curve is at 0).")

![periodic patches 1](/uploads/2017/02/som-lygiagretus.png "Periodic ovation has developed. Agents stand up and after some time sit down. A fraction of agents remains uncomfortable.")

![periodic patches 2](/uploads/2017/02/som-diagonalus.png "Periodic ovation has developed. Agents stand up and after some time sit down. A fraction of agents remains uncomfortable. The main difference from the previous example is a shape of the 'front.'")

Interactive HTML5 applet
------------------------

Bellow you should see an interactive HTML5 app, which uses the algorithm
described above. Model parameters and curves shown in the figure were
discussed in the text. Try different parameter values for yourself to
understand their importance to the observed dynamics of the model.
