Here on Physics of Risk
we once again present you a model of collective action. Last time we
have considered [Standing Ovation
Model](/plojimu-atsistojus-modelis) by
Miller and Page, in earlier years we have written a lot about
[Kirman](/tag/kirman-model) and
[Bass](/tag/bass-model) models, as well as
[correspondence between
them](/unidirectional-kirman-model). There
is another classic model, which will be covered in this post, which
models human intention to join the collective political action with
inherent risk. In this text we will consider a threshold model proposed
by Mark Granovetter.<!--more-->

Model
-----

This model was built around the idea that people belonging to different
socio-demographic groups differently perceive risk to express their
internal political attitudes. One could interpret these differences in
perception as a differing thresholds typical for certain
socio-demographic groups. Once the threshold is passed, the members of
the group start to express their attitudes. Usually via protest.

Lets us say that there is a certain number of activists, which no longer
care about their own safety. They will protest no matter how hard the
regime tries to suppress the protest. If their number is larger enough,
it is possible that the perceived risk of expression will decline with
growing number of protesters. Then the activists will be joined by the
other less fearful groups. For example - students. As the students join
the protest, the level of perceived risk will further decline and other
more fearful groups will join the protest. As long as everything goes
well, soon everyone will join the protest.

What do we mean by "everything goes well"? If the people are unhappy
with current politics, they should definitely express their attitude!
Let us consider 5 groups of agents, which are not satisfied with the
current situation in their country. For the sake of simplicity let us
say that all these five groups have exactly the same amount of agents.
Let us furthermore assume that they act according to the following
rules:

-   Agents in the 1 group are activists, they will protest no matter
    what,
-   Agents in the 2 group, will join the protest if it is larger than
    25% of the population,
-   Agents in the 3 group, will join the protest if it is larger than
    30% of the population,
-   Agents in the 4 group, will join the protest if it is larger than
    25% of the population,
-   Agents in the 5 group, will join the protest if it is larger than
    40% of the population.

How large the protest will be? The answer is rather simple - despite
everyone being unhappy with the regime, only 20% (all agents in group 1)
will join the protest. It is so because the members of group 2 have a
large threshold of 25%.

If the threshold is set to a lower value, lets say 15%, then the protest
will eventually involve everybody.

By changing number of group, their respective sizes and thresholds we
could produce protests of different sizes. We could also neglect
separation into groups and assign each agent his own, possibly randomly
picked, threshold. In such case we could reproduce not only the size of
the protests, but also their "diffusion" curves. All of these curves
would have a sigmoid, stretched letter S, form. Similar curves may be
obtained from the [Kirman and Bass models](/unidirectional-kirman-model), which
suggests certain similarity between the three models. Kirman and Bass
models require less assumptions, but also have less explanatory power in
sociological terms.

Interactive HTML5 app
---------------------

This post was illustrated using figures generated using app below. Our
app uses modified interpretation of the original threshold model -
namely it includes time axis. During each time step of the model a
random agent is selected:

-   If the agent has already joined the protest, then nothing happens.
-   If the agent has not yet joined the protest, then he may do so. But
    only if the threshold assigned to his group, \\\(  T\_i \\\), is
    smaller than the number of agents currently protesting.

The model is not spatial, thus the grid on left is just for the
illustrative purpose. On the right side you should see a plot, which
shows how the number of protesting agents evolves in time. Bellow the
two figures you should see previous "history," which contains groups
agents of which have recently joined the protest.

In the app below you can change the size of the grid (total number of
agents), threshold of the 4 groups, \\\(  T\_i \\\), as well as
population fraction of agents in these groups, \\\(  p\_i \\\).

We invite you to try this app!
