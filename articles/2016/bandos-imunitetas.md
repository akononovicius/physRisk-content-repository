Recently a new movement made its way
to Lithuania - anti-vaccine movement. Some parents after reading few
texts online become convinced that vaccines are actually dangerous to
health of their children. Thus they decide no to vaccinate their
children. A brief reading online somehow trumps centuries of scientific
progress in Medicine.

While we here at Physics of Risk usually write about economical and
social systems, but the tools we use may be as effectively used to
understand the spreading of diseases. Contemporary scientific literature
usually uses network theory to find optimal vaccination strategies, but
we will not delve in this complex matter. Our aim in this text is to
show that vaccination helps saving lives of millions of people. Thus we
may use a simpler agent-based model for this.<!--more-->

## Formulation of the model

First of all let us note that agents may be either vaccinated (in the
app below they will be shown in green) or unvaccinated (shown in blue).
The probability that individual agent will be vaccinated is one of the
parameters of the model \\\(  p\_{vac} \\\). App below asks for two
values of this parameter. One of them is used for the left population of
agents, while the second one is used for the right population of agents.
These agent populations "live" on separate square grids, opposing ends
of which are connected (right-to-left, top-to-bottom).

Each of the agents may be healthy (the coloring then represents its
vaccination status), infected (shown in red) and dead (show in black).
The agents transition between these states according to simple
transition probabilities per unit of time. Healthy agent might get
infected by single other infected agent with probability \\\( p\_{hi} \\\) (each agent has 4 neighbors, has some natural immunity and may
be vaccinated, thus actual infection probability is more complex (see
below)), infected agent might become healthy again, \\\(  p\_{ih} \\\),
or die, \\\(  p\_{id} \\\).

During each time tick (we assume that it is fixed and equal to 1) each
agent interacts with 4 of his nearest neighbors. Thus each of his
infected neighbors might infect him. Let us assume that \\\( n\_{j,i} \\\) of agents \\\(  j \\\) neighbors are infected. Then the
probability that agent will not get infected from any of them equals:


\begin{equation}
 p\_{j,hh} = (1-p\_{hi})^{n\_{j,i}} . 
\end{equation}


Probability of the opposite event, that agent will get infected, is
given by:


\begin{equation}
 {\tilde p}\_{j,hi} = 1 - p\_{j,hh} = 1 -(1-p\_{hi})^{n\_{j,i}} . 
\end{equation}


Lets say that \\\(  p\_{im} \\\) describes the probability of avoiding
infection due to natural immunity. Then the probability to become
infected has the following form:


\begin{equation}
 p\_{j,hi} = (1 - p\_{im}) {\tilde p}\_{j,hi} = (1 - p\_{im}) \[1 - (1-p\_{hi})^{n\_{j,i}} \] . 
\end{equation}


Vaccinated agents are further protected. Let us say that \\\( p\_{eff} \\\) describes the probability of avoiding infection due to
vaccination. Then the probability to become infected has the following
form:


\begin{equation}
 p\_{j,v,hi} = (1-p\_{eff}) p\_{j,hi} = (1-p\_{eff}) (1 -p\_{im}) \[1 - (1-p\_{hi})^{n\_{j,i}}\] . 
\end{equation}


From the comparison between \\\(  p\_{j,hi} \\\) and \\\( p\_{j,v,hi} \\\) should evident that \\\(  p\_{j,hi} \geq p\_{j,v,hi} \\\)
(the probability of getting infected is larger for the unvaccinated
agents). This is true as due to the definition of probability, \\\(  0\leq p \leq 1 \\\), the inequality \\\(  1 \geq 1 - p\_{eff} \\\) is
always satisfied. There two edge cases in which vaccination does not
matter - ineffective vaccine, \\\(  p\_{eff} = 0 \\\), and ideal
immunity, \\\(  p\_{im} = 1 \\\). It is rather obvious that vaccines are
rigorously tested thus their are at least a bit effective (thus \\\( 0 &lt; p\_{eff} \\\)), furthermore no single individual has an ideal
immunity (inborn or obtained), thus \\\(  p\_{im} &lt; 1 \\\). Thus
vaccination improves the odds of the individual to survive.

Each infected agent, during each time tick, might become healthy again
or die. These probabilities were already discussed above, but then
setting their values it is important to satisfy the following condition:


\begin{equation}
 p\_{ih} + p\_{id} \leq 1 . 
\end{equation}


The modelling might be further complicated by introducing the impact of
immunity and vaccination (or drugs) to the probability to get healthy or
die. But this complication is not necessary in our case.

Evidently the dead agent is not able to recover during any time tick.

This model does not take into account side-effects of vaccination (e.g.,
getting infected due to vaccination). Anti-vaxxers love this argument,
but they forget that side-effects are single individual cases, while
hundreds millions of people get vaccinated each year (if not more). In
most cases it is hard to prove that vaccination caused the side-effect
in question. Having this in mind we say that the probability of causing
the side-effect would be extremely small and would not be observable in
the model.

During initial time moment, we randomly assign one agent to be patient
zero. It does not matter if his is vaccinated or not. Further spreading
of the disease should be taken into consideration.

## Results

As we already mentioned, the app allows to do the same experiment in two
population groups. This was implemented in order to allow to compare how
the disease spreads in population with low vaccination rate and in
population with high population rate. Each population is represented by
"geographical" view (i.e., the grid of agents is shown) and graph (which
illustrates certain variables changing in time).

Red curve in graphs shows how the fraction of infected agents, \\\( N\_{inf} / N \\\), changes in time. Black curve - fraction of dead agents,
\\\(  N\_{dead} / N \\\). Green and blue curves - fraction of dead agents
among vaccinated and unvaccinated agents, \\\(  N\_{dead,vac} /N\_{vac} \\\) and \\\(  N\_{dead,unv} / N\_{unv} \\\). Magenta curve -
fraction of unvaccinated agents among dead agents, \\\(  N\_{dead,unv}/ N\_{dead} \\\).

The last variable, \\\(  N\_{dead,unv} / N\_{dead} \\\), makes no sense -
it provides no useful information about the spreading of disease in
agent populations. We consider it only because anti-vaxxers like to use
one similar to it. They like to estimate the fraction of vaccinated
agents among dead agents:


\begin{equation}
 \frac{N\_{dead,vac}}{N\_{dead}} =\frac{N\_{dead}-N\_{dead,unv}}{N\_{dead}} = 1 -\frac{N\_{dead,unv}}{N\_{dead}}. 
\end{equation}


Anti-vaxxers prefer this variable due to a very simple reason. It is
extremely easy to find cases, which would imply the conclusion, which
anti-vaxxers would like to prove. But this approach is wrong (read more
on [Cherry picking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_picking) and
[Sharpshooter
fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_sharpshooter_fallacy)).
Why? Imagine we have only a single victim to the disease. What is the
probability that it was vaccinated? \\\(  p\_{vac} \\\)! If vaccination
rates are high, then usually the victim would be vaccinated. Lets say
that disease took 10-20 lives. What is the probability that majority of
them were vaccinated? Once again if vaccination rates are high, then it
might be that there will be 50-50 chance that majority of victims would
be vaccinated. So far the narration implies that it is dangerous to get
vaccinated. But let us see how many lives will be taken if vaccination
rates are low!

The important figure is the total number of victims and not the ratios
between the vaccinated and unvaccinated victims. High vaccination rates
prevent higher number of victims. Though, it is worth to note that there
should be an optimal \\\(  p\_{vac} \\\) value, implying that it is not
necessary to vaccinate everybody. Medical doctors usually recommend
vaccines to patients based on their health record. If medical doctor
believes that patient might suffer due to vaccination, the medical
doctor will not make the recommendation. Some people might have certain
health conditions, which would make vaccination dangerous to them. Yet
the people who chose not to vaccinate due to other reasons put not only
themselves, people unable to get vaccines and broader community in risk.

There will always be some individuals, who will not be saved by the
vaccine. But vaccination helps to save millions of others!

## HTML5 app

We invite you to play around with the app below to convince yourself
that vaccination helps prevent disease outbreaks.
