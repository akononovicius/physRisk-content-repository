Typically [voter models](/tag/voter-model/) assume that recruitment occurs
between two interacting individuals. Obviously recruitment can occur only if
these individuals have different opinions. While nothing will happen if
these individuals hold the same opinions. Though Latane social impact
[cite id="Latane1981"] predicts that support provided by like-minded
individuals can also play a role.

In a [previous post]({filename}/articles/2021/supportive-interactions-voter-model.md)
we have consider the case when support prevents both recruitment and
independent transitions. This needs not to be the case if we assume that
independent transitions are not influenced by the support provided by the
peers. This yields another variation of the noisy voter model with
supportive interactions, which exhibits a more complicated phase portrait.
This model is also a part of my last paper of the
[postdoctoral project](/tag/postdoctoral-project)
[cite id="Kononovicius2021CSF"].

## The model

Let the agent in the same state provide support to each other and thus
discourage switching away from the current state. Though let this support
counter only recruitment by the agents with different opinions:

\begin{equation}
    \lambda^{+} \left(X\right)=\left(N-X\right)\left(\sigma_{1}+\left[\frac{h}{N^{\alpha}}X-\frac{q}{N^{\beta}}\left(N-X\right)\right]_{+}\right),
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \lambda^{-} \left(X\right)=X\left(\sigma_{0}+\left[\frac{h}{N^{\alpha}}\left(N-X\right)-\frac{q}{N^{\beta}}X\right]_{+}\right).
\end{equation}

These are similar to the transition rates seen in the
[previous post]({filename}/articles/2021/supportive-interactions-voter-model.md).
The only difference is that the independent transition rates are outside the
special brackets, which enforce non-negativity. Other parameters retain
their usual meaning: \\\( h \\\) represents recruitment (herding) rate,
\\\( X \\\) corresponds to the number of agents in the first state and
\\\( N \\\) is the total number of agents. With \\\( \alpha = 0 \\\), the
model is non-extensive (i.e., it has a broad stationary distribution for any
\\\( N \\\)). With \\\( \alpha = 1 \\\), the model is extensive (i.e., it
has a narrow stationary distribution, which shrinks as
\\\( N \rightarrow \infty \\\). Parameter \\\( \beta \\\) has similar
meaning as \\\( \alpha \\\), but applies only to supportive interactions.

![Special points of the transition rates](/uploads/2021/imitation-supportive-rates.png "Special points of the transition rates (corresponds to Fig. 3 from the article).")

Bifurcation diagrams of this model will be a bit more complicated as few
different attraction basins exist (as can be seen in the figure above as
well as Fig. 3 in [cite id="Kononovicius2021CSF"]). The most important
points are the roots of the special brackets:

\begin{equation}
    x^{+} = \frac{N^\alpha q}{N^\beta h + N^\alpha q} ,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    x^{-} = \frac{N^\beta h}{N^\beta h + N^\alpha q} .
\end{equation}

All of the fixed points (four of them) can be categorized in relation to the
roots of the special brackets. Fixed point of the first type is observed in
the region where both special brackets evaluate to zero,
\\\( x^{-} &lt; x_{s,1} &lt; x^{+} \\\). In this region dynamics is dominated by
independent behavior. The stationary point in this case will be found at:

\begin{equation}
    x_{s,1} = \frac{\sigma\_1}{\sigma\_0 + \sigma\_1} .
\end{equation}

Fixed points of the second and third types are found whenever only one the
special brackets evaluates to zero. Fixed point of the second type will be
observed if \\\( x_{s,2}^{\pm} &lt; x^{+} \\\) and \\\( x_{s,2}^{\pm} &lt; x^{-} \\\).
While fixed point of the third type will be observed if 
\\\( x_{s,3}^{\pm} &gt; x^{+} \\\) and \\\( x_{s,3}^{\pm} &gt; x^{-} \\\). In these
cases only one of the states is being protected by the supportive
interactions. Stationary points will be found at:

\begin{equation}
    x_{s,2}^{\pm} =\frac{A\pm\sqrt{A^{2}-2B\sigma_{1}}}{B},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    x_{s,3}^{\pm} =\frac{A+2\left(N^{1-\beta}q-\sigma_{0}-\sigma_{1}\right)\pm\sqrt{A^{2}-2B\sigma_{0}}}{B}.
\end{equation}

In the above we have we have introduced convenient shorthands for the
commonly repeated expressions: 

\begin{equation}
    A=N^{1-\alpha}h+\sigma_{0}+\sigma_{1},\quad B=2N\left(N^{-\alpha}h+N^{-\beta}q\right).
\end{equation}

Fixed point of the fourth type will be observed if for some \\\( x \\\) both
of the special brackets evaluate to a positive number,
\\\( x^{+} &lt; x_{s,4} &lt; x^{-} \\\). This implies that we can't observe fixed
points of the first and fourth types at the same time. Though we can observe
fixed points of the second or third type together with either of them.
Stationary point can be observed at:

\begin{equation}
    x_{s,4}=\frac{Nq-N^{\beta}\sigma_{1}}{2Nq-N^{\beta}\left(\sigma_{0}+\sigma_{1}\right)}.
\end{equation}

Determining critical values of \\\( q \\\) at which the phase transition
occur in general case is troublesome analytically, but quite possible
numerically for the specific parameter values. Below you should see a
typical bifurcation diagram of the model (figure corresponds to Fig. 6 (b)
from [cite id="Kononovicius2021CSF"]).

## Interactive app

Use the app below to explore the phases of the noisy voter model with
supportive interactions. As in the
[previous post]({filename}/articles/2021/supportive-interactions-voter-model.md)
this app also shows you the time series plot (on the left) and the rate plot
(right). Time series plot show \\\( 10 \\\) sample trajectories, so that you
could where different trajectories tend to. Rate plot shows to curves, red
curve corresponds to death rate, while green curve corresponds to birth rate.
Rate plot allows to anticipate where the stationary points will be and whether
they will be stable. In most cases the model will converge towards stable
stationary points, so here we neglect the usual statistical analysis, but we
will revisit it in a later post
