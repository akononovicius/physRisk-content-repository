Typically [voter models](/tag/voter-model/) assume that recruitment occurs
between two interacting individuals. Obviously recruitment can occur only if
these individuals have different opinions. While nothing will happen if
these individuals hold the same opinions. Though Latane social impact
[cite id="Latane1981"] predicts that support provided by like-minded
individuals can also play a role. In this post I'll discuss my last work done
during my [postdoctoral project](/tag/postdoctoral-project)
[cite id="Kononovicius2021CSF"], which introduces supportive interactions
into the [voter model](/tag/voter-model/).

## The model

Let the agent in the same state provide support to each other and thus
discourage switching away from the current state. First we will assume that
this support discourages both independent and imitative transitions:

\begin{equation}
    \lambda^{+} \left(X\right)=\left(N-X\right)\left[\sigma_{1}+\frac{h}{N^{\alpha}}X-\frac{q}{N^{\beta}}\left(N-X\right)\right]_{+},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \lambda^{-} \left(X\right)=X\left[\sigma_{0}+\frac{h}{N^{\alpha}}\left(N-X\right)-\frac{q}{N^{\beta}}X\right]_{+}.
\end{equation}

These are mostly the usual transition rates of the noisy voter model with
\\\( \sigma\_i \\\) standing for independent transition rates, \\\( h \\\)
representing recruitment (herding) rate, \\\( X \\\) corresponding to the
number of agents in the first state and \\\( N \\\) being total number of
agents. If \\\( \alpha = 0 \\\), then the noisy voter model would be
non-extensive (has broad stationary distribution for any \\\( N \\\)). While
for \\\( \alpha = 1 \\\) the model is extensive (has narrow stationary
distribution, which shrinks as \\\( N \rightarrow \infty \\\).

The above rates are different from the usual transition rates due to the
third term in the square brackets, which describes interaction with
like-minded peers. Two new parameters control the interaction: \\\( q \\\)
is the supportive interaction rate, while \\\( \beta \\\) has the same
meaning as \\\( \alpha \\\), but applies only to supportive interactions.
As you can see this interaction decreases the respective transition rate.
These rates make sense only if they are non-negative, so we have to assign
the square brackets a special meaning:

\begin{equation}
    \left[z\right]_{+}=\max\left(z,0\right).
\end{equation}

Purely from examining the transition rates it is clear that the model will
posses four distinct phases (three if \\\( \sigma\_0 = \sigma\_1 \\\)):

* In the <span style="color: #ee0011">first phase</span> both rates are
positive for all \\\( X \\\). In this phase this model is equivalent to the
noisy voter model with appropriately adjusted parameter values. This phase is
observed if \\\( q < N^{\beta-1} \min\left(\sigma\_0, \sigma\_1\right) \\\).
* In the <span style="color: #ff7788">second phase</span> one of the rates
would become negative, if not for the brackets, and the effects of the
supportive interactions become more visible. Namely, the system is being
quickly pushed towards consensus surrounding the more "attractive" state
(one associated with larger \\\( \sigma\_i \\\)). This phase is observed if
\\\( q < N^{\beta-1} \max\left(\sigma\_0, \sigma\_1\right) \\\).
* In the <span style="color: #44bbff">third phase</span> both of the rates
would become negative, if not for the brackets. This phase is characterized
by three stationary points, with the two consensuses being stable and the
intermediate state being unstable. This phase is observed if
\\\( q < N^{\beta-\alpha-1} \left(N h+N^{\alpha}\left(\sigma_{0}+
\sigma_{1}\right)\right) \\\).
* In the <span style="color: #0044ee">fourth phase</span> for certain values
of \\\( X \\\) both of the transition rates would be negative, if not for the
brackets. If you start at such \\\( X \\\), then the system would remain at
\\\( X \\\). This phase is observed if
\\\( q \geq N^{\beta-\alpha-1} \left(N h+N^{\alpha}\left(\sigma_{0}+
\sigma_{1}\right)\right) \\\).

An example of a bifurcation diagram of the model, with all 4 phases
visible, is given below. While bifurcation diagram retains its qualitative
behavior, but it slightly varies with \\\( \alpha \\\) and \\\( \beta \\\).
Most notably with \\\( \alpha = 0 \\\) the first phase is characterized by a
stationary distribution, which is Beta distribution. Also some of the critical
points, ones separating the distinct phases, either go to zero or diverge
towards infinity as \\\( N \rightarrow \infty \\\). This means that in
certain scenarios not all phases will be observable. For a more complete
picture of the phase behavior of the model see Fig. 2 in
[cite id="Kononovicius2021CSF"].

## Interactive app

Use the app below to explore the four phases of the noisy voter model with
supportive interactions. This app shows you two plots: time series plot
(on the left) and rates plot (right). Time series plot show \\\( 10 \\\)
sample trajectories, so that you could where different trajectories tend to.
Rate plot shows to curves, red curve corresponds to death rate, while green
curve corresponds to birth rate. Rate plot allows to anticipate where the
stationary points will be and whether they will be stable. In most cases the
model will converge towards stable stationary points, so we neglect the usual
statistical analysis.
