Do you remember a talk
["Who controls the world?
"](/james-b-glattfelder-kas-valdo-pasauli "James B. Glattfelder: Who controls the world?")
given by J. B. Glatterfelder on the
[ted.com](http://www.ted.com/talks/james_b_glattfelder_who_controls_the_world.html)
website? If not, you could go ant watch now or rely on us. As far as we
remember the key point behind the talk is a scientific discovery of a
fact that few hundred of large financial institutions control majority
of the smaller financial institutions all around the world.
Interestingly enough these large financial institutions also control
each other! In this text we will give some examples which will show that
similar network topologies may form not only due to the conspiracy of
these institutions, but also due to the other reasons.

Thus in this text we continue our topic on the [network formation
models](/tag/network-formation-models). This
time we will be interested in the so-called core-periphery network
formation models, which will grow networks with well pronounced core and
periphery.<!--more-->

Core and periphery in the networks
----------------------------------

From time to time, even then using
[Erdos-Renyi](/erdos-renyi-model "Erdos-Renyi model")
or
[Barabasi-Albert](/barabasi-albert-model "Barabasi-Albert model")
network formation models, we may obtain networks with two differently
wired groups of nodes. Lets say that the first group of nodes is tightly
interconnected, while the other is very sparsely interconnected or not
interconnected at all. Though the nodes in the second group are
connected to the nodes from the first group. In this case the first
group would be called a core, while the second would be referred to as a
periphery. The concepts of the network core and periphery are visually
explained in [Fig. 1](#attachment_2507).

model. Nodes in the red area belong to core, while the nodes in the blue
area are in periphery."){#attachment_2507} 

What is so special about the core-periphery networks? They are very
resilient in a sense that ideal core-periphery network does not suffer
much from the removal of nodes. Namely if you remove a node from an
ideal core-periphery network, it doesn't matter if you remove core or
periphery node, you do not destroy the network structure. If you remove
the core node, the other core nodes will still have the same links the
removed node had, so no other nodes would get separated from the
surviving network. If you remove a periphery node, you just remove an
unimportant node, which was just connected to the core and not to other
nodes, so once again you have just remove a single node and a couple of
edges. So, no matter which node you remove, the surviving network
remains interconnected. It is worthwhile to note that real
core-periphery networks are far from being ideal, yet the impact of node
removal would still be comparatively small - only one branch of networks
nodes would be separated from the surviving network and its size would
be significantly smaller than the size of the whole network.

Obtaining ideal core-periphery network
--------------------------------------

It is not very hard task to generate the ideal core-periphery network.
At first you should decided how many nodes will make up the core of the
network. Next create the selected number of nodes and connect them (all
nodes to all nodes!). Then add a chosen number of periphery nodes.
Connect them to all of the core nodes. In this manner you will obtain an
ideal core-periphery network.

Yet this network topology is pretty boring - it is deterministic (only
influenced by an externally made choice)! What else should we expect.

This algorithm, and some simple, but less ideal, are describe in the
paper by Borgatti and Everett \[cite id="Borgatti2000SN"\] (see it if
you want to know more).

"Destroy the core-periphery network" challenge!
-----------------------------------------------

We have written above that the core-periphery networks are almost
indestructible. Namely they are immune to node removal. You can test
this claim using the app bellow. Your aim should be a destruction of the
network without fully destroying its core. The nodes are destroyed by
pressing "X" button, which is found near every node. If it is necessary
you can move the nodes by dragging, and also restart app by pressing
"&gt;" button.

Modifying Erdos-Renyi model to recover core-periphery network model
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We could randomly "grow" a core-periphery network by using [Erdos-Renyi
model](/erdos-renyi-model "Erdos-Renyi model").
To make task easier let us modify the Erdos-Renyi model. First let us
assume that our nodes are of two types and thus the connection
probabilities become inhomogeneous. Namely we now will have not one, but
multiple connection, edge forming, probabilities depending on which two
nodes could be connected. As three distinct parings are possible we will
have three distinct connection probabilities: \\\(  p\_{11} \\\) for the
two nodes of first type to be connected, \\\(  p\_{22} \\\) for the two
nodes of second type to connected and finally \\\(  p\_{12} =p\_{21} \\\) for the connection between the nodes of differing types.

To completely avoid determinism we will assign types to nodes randomly -
we will have a probability \\\(  p\_{c1} \\\) that a new node is of the
first type, and \\\(  p\_{c2} \\\) that a new node is of the second type.
To avoid some problems, or possibly overly complex implementation of the
model, we will assume that the first type nodes are the core nodes and
we will require that at least one node of this type actually exists.

Note that the app shows only the nodes which are connected to the core
nodes. All of the other nodes are not shown.

Similar algorithm is used in \[cite id="Persitz2010SSRN,
Rombach2012CoRR"\]. Reference \[cite id="Persitz2010SSRN"\] considers a
network model based on the deterministic utility functions (with
conditional payoffs depending on the agent types), while the network
considered in reference \[cite id="Rombach2012CoRR"\] is random, but its
connection probabilities are inter-coupled.

The core and periphery formed in this case due to the assumption we put
in the model. Namely we decided to have two types of nodes - attractive
ones (core nodes) and less-attractive ones (periphery nodes).

Core-periphery networks form the Barabasi-Albert model
------------------------------------------------------

We can also obtain a network with almost scale-free structure, visible
core and periphery. This time the modification of the underlying model
is rather minimal - we just have to assume that the "growth" of the
scale-free network starts from \\\(  N\_{0} \\\) fully interconnected
nodes and further the [original
algorithm](/barabasi-albert-model "Barabasi-Albert model")
is used. Note that in this case we will observe newly formed hubs (the
nodes with large degrees) in the periphery, though the core nodes should
still have larger degrees.

This time the core was dictated by the history of the network - it
existed before we started to grow the network.

Strategic emergence of the core-periphery network topology
----------------------------------------------------------

We have already written that \[cite id="Persitz2010SSRN"\] work relies
on the utility functions to shape the core-periphery network. But how is
it possible? For a start let us note that the utility functions of each
agent (which is placed in the network nodes) depends on the network
topology. Namely if an agent can easily communicate with many other
agents, his utility function is larger. It appears that such agents
should form completely connected network. The intuition is right, but in
the real world in order to keep relationship (or connection) alive the
nodes have to pay a certain price. So the completely connected network
is no longer effective nor desired by the agents. They now attempt to
gain as much from communication with other agents, but to lose as few
resources as possible. In certain cases, for details see \[cite
id="Persitz2010SSRN"\], in this interplay of cost and benefit the
core-periphery network topology emerges.

So the core-periphery network topology may also emerge from a need to
cooperate. Direct communication is costly, so part of the agents have to
play a role of hubs. It is worth to recall that in the model proposed in
\[cite id="Persitz2010SSRN"\] the agents are divided into core and
periphery agents, so the core forms not for the natural endogenous
reasons, but once again it forms from the exogenous reasons. This may be
bypassed by assuming that agents initializing connection have to pay
whole "price" for the connection (namely to have directed network). In
such case the hubs are being subsidized by the periphery and thus may
emerge endogenously \[cite id="Hojman2006"\].
