In the
1738, Daniel Bernoulli, the very same known for his contribution to
fluid dynamics, in his paper in the "Commentaries of the Imperial
Academy of Science of Saint Petersburg" described an interesting
paradox. Let us assume that we have a fair 50-50 game in which the host
tosses a coin until the tail appears. After each toss he pays a player
\\\(  2^n  \\\) (where \\\(  n \\\) is a number of the toss) of
money. The problem in question is - what is an optimal price for the
game? Namely how much money the host should ask from a player, that he
would be still motivated to play the game, yet also preventing
unnecessary losses by the host.<!--more-->

There is no direct answer for this problem, because the expected
winnings are infinite,


\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{E} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{4} +\ldots + 2^n \cdot 2^{-n} + \ldots = \sum\_{i=1}^\infty 2^i\cdot 2^{-i} = \infty , 
\end{equation}


while the player does not believe that he would be able to win that
much.

What is wrong? The problem in question requires the game to posses the
characteristic scale, while there is no characteristic scale in this
problem.

I have seen this paradox for a first time in a book by Mantegna and
Stanley \[cite id="Mantegna2000Cambridge"\], yet slightly earlier I have
seen an inverse formulation of the paradox. In the inverse formulation
the lack of characteristic scale is seen more clearly (and dangerously).

Inverse formulation
-------------------

Once during the under-graduate years one friend have told me that he
invented a "fool-proof" gambling strategy. The strategy assumes a fair,
or almost fair, 50-50 game and suggests the player to bid 1 unit of
money after each win, while the bid should be doubled after each loss (2
units after first loss, 4 units after the second, ..., \\\(  2^n \\\) after the n-th). The strategy appears to be "fool-proof" as the
cumulative loss grows as \\\(  2^n -1  \\\), thus after the streak
of losses has been broken (and it will eventually be broken) the player
still makes a profit.

But what if he losses more than he has money? No real person has an
infinite amount of money required by this "fool-proof" strategy. So in
the end some streak of losses will be a final streak as the player will
be unable to further increase his bets.

![One
of the tipical realizations while using the discussed strategy. As
everything goes well it appears that there is no risk - income is
steady, but even shortest streak of losses might result in a
bankruptcy.](/uploads/2013/02/st-petersburg-graph-en.jpg "
