In classical physics
differential equations is the main tool to mathematically describe
dynamical systems. Having obtained the mathematical descriptions of the
system we should be able to predict the evolution of the system. It is
noted that the evolution of the classical systems is pretty trivial - no
matter what the initial condition is the system will "find" the stable
state. Usually dissipative forces (such as frictions) are to be blamed
for this. Though not all systems are so
simple...<!--more-->

In the literature those stable state are frequently called attractors.
These attractors can not only "pull in" trajectories, but they also can
"repel" them. Furthermore on the two dimensional plane one other types
of attractors might exist. For example certain attractor might "pull in"
some trajectories and at the same time "repel" some of them. Some
attractors might even "force" the trajectories cycle around them. But
the most interesting attractors are known as strange attractors and they
"force" strange, supposedly random or chaotic, behavior around them.
This behavior most of time posses features of dynamical chaos and has
fractal features (ex., fractional dimension).

We will further consider the generation of these, strange, attractors...

Method
------

The essence of this method is a solution of the non-linear recurrence
equations. Generally speaking the set of equations might be composed of
two or more iterative equations and the exponent of non-linearity might
have very different values. In this text we will limit ourselves to the
case of the two equations with quadratic non-linearity. Namely:


\begin{equation}
 \left\\\{ \begin{aligned} x\_{n+1} =& a\_0 x\_n^2 + a\_1 x\_ny\_n + a\_2 x\_n + a\_3 y\_n^2 + a\_4 y\_n + a\_5 , \\\\ y\_{n+1} =&b\_0 x\_n^2 + b\_1 x\_n y\_n + b\_2 x\_n + b\_3 y\_n^2 + b\_4 y\_n +b\_5 , \end{aligned} \right. 
\end{equation}


here \\\(  a\_i \\\) and \\\(  b\_i \\\) are random coefficients. Each of
these coefficients is given a random value in \\\(  \[-2, 2\]  \\\). This
random value is assigned at the start of every new evaluation of the
series.

Note that not all of the randomly generated coefficient sets will make
up attractors with interesting properties. Most of the time you will
actually obtain the trivial cases of convergence, divergence of
trajectories or cyclically orbiting trajectories. Consequently any piece
of software used to generate the strange attractors in this manner
should have some kind of "filter" implemented to drop the trivial
trajectories.

Interactive model
-----------------

Bellow you should be able to fined small applet, which enables
generation of random strange attractors (using the method discussed
above). In this applet we have implemented some filters, which remove
the trivial attractors, though note that the algorithm behind the filter
is a very simple, thus it is probable that some of the trivial results
will still appear. We encourage you to actively use the "Generate
attractor" button.

The applet uses 5 shades of gray to color the trajectory points. The
brighter point is the older it is (namely it was generated earlier than
a darker one). Therefore in certain cases, if the stable cyclic
trajectory exists and is reachable within 5000 iterations, black points
will correspond to the trajectory of strange attractor.

Previously the interactive model was powered by Wolfram CDF technology.
The old app can still be downloaded from
