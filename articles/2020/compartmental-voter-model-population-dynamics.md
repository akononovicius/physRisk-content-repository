Today we continue our [series of posts](/tag/compartmental-voter-model) on
compartmental voter model. Recently I had another idea how to examine the
impact of the finite capacity on the
[compartmental voter model]({filename}/articles/2020/compartmental-voter-model.md)
dynamics. And this approach also involves populations dynamics in the model.

For a different approach see the
[earlier post]({filename}/articles/2020/compartmental-voter-model-finite-capacity.md)
on the finite capacity in the compartmental voter model.

The app we make available with this post is quite similar to the one from the
[earlier post]({filename}/articles/2020/compartmental-voter-model.md), but
this one is different as we report distinct quantities: total number of agents
in the compartment (blue dots) and scaled number of agents of the first type
(red dots). We report spatial rank share distributions for both of them.

If capacity would have no impact on the model dynamics, then both observables
would have similar rank-size distributions and the curves would noticeably
overlap.
