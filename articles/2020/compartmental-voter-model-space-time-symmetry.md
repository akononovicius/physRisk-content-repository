Today we continue our [series of posts](/tag/compartmental-voter-model) on
compartmental voter model. Today we ask a question: is there a symmetry between
stationary (temporal) and spatial distributions? Note that we have observed
this symmetry in the
[infinite capacity case]({filename}/articles/2020/compartmental-voter-model.md),
but we haven't yet looked from this perspective in the finite capacity case. In
this case we just know that we no longer observe the Beta distributions, which
we have observed in the
[infinite capacity case]({filename}/articles/2020/compartmental-voter-model.md).

In the
[last post]({filename}/articles/2020/compartmental-voter-model-finite-capacity.md)
we have looked at the finite capacity case when the number of compartments,
\\\( M \\\), is small. We have mentioned that in this case spatial rank-size
distributions would be not very informative. Now let us consider larger
\\\( M \\\) and make a comparison between the spatial rank-size distribution
and the temporal rank-size distribution. Given some time for the temporal
distribution converge, we should see that both rank-size distributions are
quite similar.

![Temporal \(red\) vs spatial \(blue\) rank-size distribution: N=2600, T=2, M=100, C=30, ε=2.](/uploads/2020/cvm-symmetry.png "Temporal \(red\) vs spatial \(blue\) rank-size distribution: N=2600, T=2, M=100, C=30, ε=2.")

Note that in the figure above we study \\\( f \\\) instead of the usual
\\\( X \\\). While \\\( X \\\) stands for the total population of certain agent
type in certain compartment, \\\( f \\\) corresponds to the fraction of agents
of certain type in certain compartment:

\begin{equation}
f\_i^{(k)} = \frac{X\_i^{(k)}}{N\_i}, \qquad \text{if} \quad \; N\_i > 0 .
\end{equation}

This fraction is somewhat nicer observable, because in the empirical data we
often have compartments of very different sizes (e.g., the sizes of the polling
stations in the
[Lithuanian parliamentary election data](https://github.com/akononovicius/lithuanian-parliamentary-election-data)
vary over almost two degrees of magnitude) and thus making comparisons in
absolute numbers will often not make very much sense.

Furthermore the
[compartmental voter model]({filename}/articles/2020/compartmental-voter-model.md),
with certain parameter sets at least, seems to generate rather broad
distributions of the total number of agents in the compartment, \\\( N\_i \\\).
Therefore the population fraction is nice observable for our model, too.

The not so nice thing about the population fraction is that we could, in
theory, end up with division by zero. We resolve this issue by replacing those
cases with zeros:

\begin{equation}
f\_i = 0 , \quad \text{if} N\_i=0 .
\end{equation}

## Interactive app

Once again the app is quite similar to the one in the
[original post]({filename}/articles/2020/compartmental-voter-model.md). The main
differences are that we have two agent types (which are assumed to be
statistically indistinguishable) and a different observable. Also in this app
we report only the rank-size distributions: red dots correspond to the temporal
(stationary) distribution, blue dots correspond to the spatial distribution.
