We are concluding the [ongoing series of posts](/tag/compartmental-voter-model)
on the compartmental voter model. As in [cite id="Kononovicius2019Comp"] we
will conclude with comparing the model against
[UK census data]({filename}/articles/2020/rank-size-distribution-and-uk-census-2011-data.md).
Though note that the interactive app does not allow for the comparison - it
just allows to generate semi-realistic spatial rank-size distributions.

## Comparison figures from the article

All of the following figures report spatial rank-size distributions for the
empirical data (black curves). While the simulation data is represented by the
red shaded area, which shows 95% confidence interval. While the agreement is
not excellent, the differences are quite easy to explain - not all
socio-demographic categories (social identities) are as important when making
choice on where to live.

## Interactive app

The app we make available with this post is quite similar to the one from the
[earlier post]({filename}/articles/2020/compartmental-voter-model.md). Yet this
one has larger preset \\\( T \\\) value, which accompanied buy UI elements,
which allow to make agent types statistically distinguishable. Note that this
app is somewhat resource hungry and thus might be quite slow.
