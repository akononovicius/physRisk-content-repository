In the [last post]({filename}/articles/2020/compartmental-voter-model.md) we
have introduced you to the compartmental voter model
[cite id="Kononovicius2019Comp"]. While we have introduced the concept of
capacity and allowed for a brief exploration of it, this time we dig slightly
deeper into this topic.<!--more-->

Note that if the capacity is finite, we are no longer able to obtain close form
result. Yet we can rely on the fact that our model is in fact a Markov chain.
Thus we can obtain the stationary distribution by solving eigenproblem for the
transition matrix. While this is doable, it is extremely impractical as the
effective number of system states grows extremely fast with \\\( M \\\) and
\\\( T \\\). Thus we can obtain, in reasonable time, results for small values
of \\\( M \\\) and \\\( T \\\). While \\\( N \\\) can be larger, but it still
should not be extremely big. Note, that stationary distribution we have
obtained in certain cases posses discontinuous jumps.

Note that here we report only stationary distributions via probability density
functions. This is because with low \\\( M \\\) spatial rank-size distribution
plot is somewhat uninformative as one can have at most \\\( M \\\) points in
those plots.

## Interactive app

The app we make available with this post is quite similar to the one from the
[earlier post]({filename}/articles/2020/compartmental-voter-model.md), but
there are some important differences. Notably this app allows for different
values of \\\( T \\\) and \\\( M \\\). Though to allow for this we have imposed
another restriction: you can input just one value of \\\( \varepsilon \\\),
which is assumed to be the same for all agent types. This effectively means
that different agents types are statistically indistinguishable as all relevant
characteristics are the same.

So, this time feel free to explore the implications of finite capacity with low
\\\( T \\\) and \\\( M \\\). Note that with \\\( \varepsilon < 1 \\\) you are
likely to observe discontinuous distributions of \\\( X \\\).
