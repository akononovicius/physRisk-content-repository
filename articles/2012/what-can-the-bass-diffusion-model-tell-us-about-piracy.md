Recently
in Lithuanian and world's different or global social spaces there was a
lot of disccusion on anti-piracy and the proportionality of so-called
"protection" of intelectual properties. The US politicians consider SOPA
and PIPA, while EU countries one after another expressed will to join
ACTA. In Lithuanian media and blogosphere, as most probably in the rest
of the world, has split into the [ACTA
supporter](http://mokslas.delfi.lt/technology/acaplikas-sprendimas-prisijungti-prie-acta-yra-teisingas.d?id=55518815)
and [oppositioner](http://www.kroitus.com/2012/02/26/tai-kas-gi-vagia/)
camps.<!--more-->

It is rather easy to notice that representatives from both camps
sometimes base themselves on the ideological "truths" and personal
experiences. Most of arguments by the ACTA supporters nicely fit into
the phrase "property is sacred", which is one of the main postulates of
liberal ideology. The only thing that is strange here is that another
postulate of the same ideology is the sacrality economic and social
freedom of each individual. Which is obviously breached if very person
using the Internet is assumed to be criminal by definition. ACTA's
opposition relies on a more diverse set of arguments. Yet I find the
notion of how common plagiarism and intellectual piracy is inside the
intellectual creation process itself to be the key point. Actually I
myself have dealt with artists who use pirated software to produce their
intellectual product, yet asking money for their own service. In
Lithuania we have also had numerous plagiarism scandals ranging from the
music to monumental art (ex. sculptures). But let us stop here while we
can - we are interested in the fundamental truths, not ideology or
personal experiences. Let us attempt to understand the actual and
observed reality!

By the way on the Internet I have found two more-or-less professionally
written texts (though I am aware that most probably there are more of
them) - see [lawyer M.
Kiškis](http://kiskis.eu/post/17969820474/trigrasis-apie-acta/) and
[sepuku.lt](http://www.sepuku.lt/?p=2048) blogs. In the first text the
ACTA is tackled from the legal point of view, while the second is based
on the scientific research \[cite id="Dahaner2012"\]. Further in text I
will also rely on the scientific works relevant in terms of Physics of
Risk - namely I will use the Bass diffusion model \[cite
id="Bass1969ManSci"\] and review by Prasad and Mahajan \[cite
id="Prasad2003IJResMar"\].

The links to other websites above are available only in Lithuanian.
Writing this text I am mostly concerned with Lithuania, though the
actual ideas bellow are not geo-centric. Either way for serious analysis
in English I refer you to the [cited works](#cited).

Introducing piracy into the Bass model
--------------------------------------

Evidently the piracy can be introduced into the Bass model by including
"shadow" diffusion process, which unlike the main diffusion process does
not provide profit, though otherwise it is the same. Thus the market
potential is divided into the legal consumers and pirates. The ratio of
between these groups is determined by the availability of the product
(depends on the price and the consumers income) and the tolerance of
piracy. Mathematically this ideas are put down like this \[cite
id="Prasad2003IJResMar"\]:


\begin{equation}
 \partial\_t X(t) = f(p(t)) \left\[ N-X(t)-Y(t) \right\]\left\[ \sigma +\frac{h}{N} \{X(t) - Y(t)\} \right\] , 
\end{equation}



\begin{equation}
 \partial\_t Y(t) = \alpha \left\[ N-X(t)-Y(t) \right\]\left\[ \sigma +\frac{h}{N} \{X(t) - Y(t)\} \right\] , 
\end{equation}


here \\\(  N \\\) is a market potential (total amount of agents in the
system, the theoretical limit for the product adoption), \\\(  X \\\) -
number of legal adopters at a given time, \\\(  Y \\\) - number of
pirates at a given time, \\\(  \sigma \\\) - coefficient of innovation,
\\\(  h \\\) - coefficient of imitation, \\\(  f(p(t)) \\\) - availability
of product as a function of price, \\\(  \alpha \\\) - tolerance of the
piracy. The above equations might be further generalized by assuming
that tolerance of piracy might vary in time and etc. Though for our
simple analysis this model should suffice.

Model equations suggest that:

-   If the price is large, and thus the availability of product is low,
    and/or piracy is tolerated, then piracy will prevail in the market.
    In the opposite case consumers will tend to choose legal product.
-   Piracy hastens product diffusion.
-   Piracy is the main cause for the lost profit.

First two suggestions are correct and are justified by analyzing
empirical data. While the third suggestion is caused by the simplicity
of the model - it is highly doubtful that all of the pirates would
become legals under certain conditions. Another point ruling out the
third suggestion is that precise evaluation of actual market potential
is very troublesome task (if completable at all). Thus the profit might
be also lost due to overestimation of the market potential.

The analysis of different scenarios: constant tolerance, initial tolerance and "charity"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Having in mind the aforementioned simplicity of the model let us study
the curves plotted in [Fig. 1](#attachment_2288). In this figure we see
the diffusion of product if piracy is present (blue curve) and absent
(green curve). Note that blue curve grows significantly faster than the
green one, though the green one reaches larger value than the blue one.
If piracy is present it "consumes" part of the market potential (red
curve).

(pirates - red curve; legal consumers - blue curve). Model parameters
are identical in both cases. On the abscissa axis we plot time, t, while
on the ordinate we plot the number of consumers,
X."){#attachment_2288} 

One could stop tolerating piracy after a certain moment to gain both
momentum and gain more money \[cite id="Prasad2003IJResMar"\]. This
scenario is shown in [Fig. 2](#attachment_2289). Note that once again
diffusion is faster then pirates are present, yet in this case larger
profit is gained as more consumers are legals.

(pirates - red curve; legal consumers - blue curve). Model parameters

cases."){#attachment_2289} 

One might consider another marketing strategy. One could further
increase the speed of diffusion by giving away the product for free or
with large discounts. The model stays the same as in case with "shadow"
diffusion, but the "shadow" diffusion term remains constant, \\\( Y(t) = Y\_0 \\\). As you can see in [Fig. 3](#attachment_2290) profit loss
once again stays minimal, yet the diffusion is even faster.

pirates (blue curve) and with "){#attachment_2290} 

The full effectiveness of the previous approach can not be seen from the
point of our analysis. Recall that our model is very simple - namely
modeled market doesn't have any structure (every agent is connected to
every other agent), while the real markets have structures. Some
elements of real markets have a lot more influence than others as they
are socially active and widely available. Choosing to facilitate product
diffusion among them would be a very wise choice as it would also
significantly facilitate product diffusion among other market elements.

Somewhat ideological moral or "instead of conclusions"
------------------------------------------------------

As we have shown in the above tolerance of piracy is an excellent
marketing tool, which helps to improve the spread of the newly
introduced product. This conclusion also applies towards markets with
competition (note that our simple model considers only monopolist
market). It is so as if we would have two products of similar perceived
quality and similar availability, market would adopt the one, which is
more pirated, namely which tolerates the piracy more. This conclusion is
also made in \[cite id="Prasad2003IJResMar"\] after studying a bit more
complex model.

Interesting, and important in context of ACTA, notion is that seeing
piracy as excellent marketing strategy is not new. \[cite
id="Prasad2003IJResMar"\] argues that this strategy was used by
Microsoft to obtain leading position in Taiwan market. And after
obtaining leading position in Taiwan, Microsoft has cracked down
software pirates in this country. Similar strategy was also used to
conquer Chinese market, but the conquest is not yet completed thus the
piracy in China is tolerated. This poses an interesting question - is
the piracy genuinely a bad thing (as ACTA supporters claim) or it is
just the market manipulation tool, which is not useful anymore in
certain countries.

The "charity" scenario is also very interesting as it is even more
effective than tolerance of piracy. So in order to gain the most we have
to present the product to the most active social elements. In case of
software there two very active social elements - governmental
organizations and public (and private?) schools. Due to the software
adoption in schools most of kids would assumed to be taught using only
the presented software, thus after graduating they might be unable to
use the the other (possibly analogous) pieces of software. While
software adoption in governmental organizations forces adults and
business to adopt same kind of software, because effective electronic
communication would be only possible if both parties use the same
standardized software.

It is interesting to note, yet it is not surprising, that this strategy
is also widely applied. In Lithuania most schools use the same software
to teach kids. Thus in the end only a few school graduates are aware
that Windows and Microsoft Office have their corresponding alternatives.
Also most of governmental organizations use Microsoft Office "native"
formats to convey information to the people (ex. presenting templates
.doc on their websites).

Therefore for me it is very strange why we have this situation? Why the
(Lithuanian) politicians, who were not previously concerned with
software piracy problems, without any discussion are eager to ratify
questionable agreements, which possible infringe human rights? Why the
first idea in their heads is to capture and punish? Why they do not care
about educating society and increasing accessibility of electronic
government (ex. by legislating open standards)?

Note that this analysis is mostly based on the example of software
piracy, yet the same mathematical formalism applies towards other types
of industries. Though the other industries might have their own specific
qualities, might be needed to account for on theoretical level. In case
of multimedia industry one could use works by A. Ishii \[cite
id="Ishii2010EconoPhysColl, Ishii2012NJP, Ishii2012PTP"\] to improve
understanding of the diffusion of multimedia products. Though the
specifics of the industries should not influence the general conclusions
reached in this analysis.
