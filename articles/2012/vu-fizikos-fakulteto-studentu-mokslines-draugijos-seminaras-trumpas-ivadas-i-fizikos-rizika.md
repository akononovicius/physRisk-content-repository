**Topic:**
"Physics is not a risk: Brief introduction into the Physics of Risk"  
**Speaker:** [Aleksejus Kononovičius](http://kononovicius.lt/en/)  
**Briefly:** Social sciences have accomplished many different things.
Yet it should be evident that there is a place for improvements - to
look into the old and new social problems a bit differently. As many of
the social problems are strongly non-linear and very complex, the
physicists' point of view is very useful. This, new, point of view is
known as Physics of Risk.  
**When?** 18th of October, 17:00.
