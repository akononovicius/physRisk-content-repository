In
mathematics and computation theory there are a class of cellular
automatons which are known as elementary automatons. This class of
cellular automatons is restricted to the one dimensional grid (in the
figures below the second dimension, ordinate (vertical) axis, is time)
with cells either on or off. Another important simplification is that
the actual state of the cell at given time, \\\(  x\_{i,t}  \\\),
depends only on the previous state of the same cell and the previous
states of its immediate neighbors, i.e. on \\\( \{x\_{i-1,t-1},x\_{i,t-1},x\_{i+1,t-1}\} \\\). Due to these restrictions
and simplifications, generally speaking cellular automatons might evolve
in the infinite dimensions, have infinite neighborhoods and have
limitless number of possible cell states, these cellular automatons
appear to be very simple, though as we show below they can replicate
very complex and even chaotic behavior.<!--more-->

These cellular automatons in some literature are named Wolfram's
elementary programs as S. Wolfram was the first one who took up an
interest in this kind of automatons. In his book "New Kind of Science"
he notes that (differential) equations are unable to describe and fully
explain some of the complex phenomena, while the world, be it nature or
the Universe, itself loves elegant simplicity. Thus, as he claims, it is
the best choice to look for the elementary laws behind the world and the
elementary cellular automaton framework might be the one to provide
interesting results. Actually as we show below this claim is at least
partly true as even elementary cellular automatons might reproduce very
complex and even chaotic behavior.

Describing the rules behind the elementary automaton
----------------------------------------------------

Recall that the cells of elementary cellular automaton might only be on
or off. We also know that the future state of cell is defined by the
states of three cells, itself and its immediate neighbors. So in order
to introduce full description of the automaton's evolution we will need
to defined eight distinct elementary, or neighborhood, rules. The
requirement follows from the \\\(  2^3=8  \\\) (it covers all
possible configurations). Thus there is a possibility of 256 rules
describing global behavior, \\\(  2^8=256  \\\) (total number of all
possible neighborhood rule configurations). One of the possible global
rules is shown below in [Fig. 1](#attachment_2264).

![image](/uploads/2012/01/elementary-ca-rule110.png "Rule 110 of elementary cellular automaton. In the first
line you can see eight distinct sets of the initial conditions, i.e. all
possible configurations of three neighborhood cells. On the second line
you can see the set of eight possible results, each related to the
condition drawn above them - empty cells in the second line means off,
while cells with square inside mean that they will be on if the
condition is
met."){#attachment_2264} 

Note that the rule shown in [Fig. 1](#attachment_2264) is known as rule
110. This notation, decimal number notation, is more comfortable than
the full description as its shorter, more compact and more easily
remembered. This number follows simply from the set of future
configurations - just turn the on-off pattern into the binary number.
The second line of [Fig. 1](#attachment_2264) has the 01101110 on-off
pattern. One can convert this binary number into the decimal like this:


\begin{equation}
 0 \cdot 2^7 + 1 \cdot 2^6 + 1 \cdot 2^5 + 0 \cdot 2^4 +1 \cdot 2^3 + 1 \cdot 2^2 + 1 \cdot 2^1 + 0 \cdot 2^0 = 64 +32+8 +4 +2 = 110 . 
\end{equation}


In [Fig. 2](#attachment_2263) we have shown how cellular automaton
governed by the rule 110 evolves globally - what interesting structure
it does posses. [Fig. 3](#attachment_2266) is a close up on the [Fig.
2](#attachment_2263) made in order to illustrate how the rule presented
in [Fig. 1](#attachment_2264) is applied in order to get the future
generation of cells. Three distinct neighborhoods have been highlighted
in [Fig. 3](#attachment_2266) to show the agreement with rule 110, but
feel free to study other neighborhoods to reassure yourself that shown
cellular automaton indeed is governed by the rule 110.

occurs in the cylinder space (the left and right edges are

generations are shown higher while younger ones are in the
bottom."){#attachment_2263}

110. The red arrows point from the cells that influence the state to

states."){#attachment_2266} 

Other more interesting rules for the elementary cellular automaton
------------------------------------------------------------------

Not all of the 256 possible global rules provide interesting structures.
Some the rules are trivial - they either disappear immediately or with
some small oscillations dissipate towards some fixed structure. But
there also are some interesting structures - periodic, chaotic and long
lasting complex structures. In the table below you can see a list of
some of the more interesting rules which we recommend to try using in
the applet below.

Interactive applet
------------------

Usage of the applet is very simple - before doing actual evaluation you
should input the rule and provide the first, input, generation of cells.
Rule can be selected using the form show in [Fig. 1](#attachment_2264) -
just press mouse on the second line of cells in the form. First
generation of cells might be also set using a mouse - just turn on or
off the cells in the first line of the grid. If you do not want to
provide first generation manually you can also press the button
"Colonize" (the probability of on-cell might be set in the text field
nearby). Next you can evaluate cellular automaton automatically (until
the allocated grid ends) by using "Start" button. You can also
evaluation generation one by one - just use the button "Iteration".

If you came here to find the previously used Java applet, it is still
available
[here](/uploads/models/old-java/cellular-automata-elementary-en.html).
The functionality of both applets is almost identical.
